Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,2,"Most of us, and even most of our parents and grandparents, grew up in an age-segregated school system, which makes contemporary school systems seem natural and universal. Children are organized by ages into grades and proceed through a school system of sequential grade levels and curricula. According to Stone and Burriss ( 2019 ), age-segre- gation schooling is founded on a factory model and is a product of the Industrial Revolu- tion that has permeated the world for 200 years. Learning is seen as a sequence of discrete skills that became more complex from year to year, and children of the same age are assumed to be the same in terms of development and needs. Children, at least children in US public schools, typically go outside for recess breaks to play with same-age peers in the same class and often do not have opportunities at school to play with children from other grades."

Many of these skills are not explicitly taught in the class- room, but can be learned as children engage in unstructured play (Hirsh-Pasek, Golinko ff , Berk, & Singer,  2009 ), especially with children of di ff erent ages. Vygotsky ( 1978 ) stressed the importance of the social environment and social interaction with others, particularly those who are more skilled, for children ’ s cognitive development. To him, play is a critical learning experience that shapes the mental processes and lays the foundations for children ’ s most successful functioning in years to come (Bodrova & Leong,  2007 )."
Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,3,"Mixed-age grouping, also known as multiage grouping, heterogeneous grouping, ver- tical grouping, family grouping, and ungraded classes, is the practice of placing children who are at least a year apart in age into the same group or class (Katz, Evangelou, & Hartman,  1990 , Pool, Bijleveld, & Tavecchio,  2000 ). Unlike the factory model, such grouping assumes that children vary in development and needs in ways not fully predict- able by age and that children can learn from those who are older and younger. Mixed- aged classrooms have been shown to be effective, as older children have opportunities to be leaders and teachers (Montessori,  1979 ), younger children can bene fi t from the modeling of older children (Kappler & Roellke,  2002 ), and teachers are able to provide di ff erentiated, developmentally-appropriate curriculum to the range of students (Kappler & Roellke,  2002 , Lloyd,  1999 ). Yet only a handful of studies (Gray,  2013 , 2017 , Stone,  2017 , Stone & Burriss,  2019 ) have speci fi cally explored the bene fi ts of mixed-age grouping in play, largely because of the continued practice of age segregation in classrooms and on playgrounds (Gray,  2013 ). An even smaller number of studies have examined multiage outdoor play (Beresin,  2010 , Brown & Taylor,  2008 , Gray,  2013 , Gray & Feldman,  2004 , Holmes,  2012 , Rouse,  2015 ), and this is the  fi rst study to speci fi cally examine Let Grow Play Club ."

Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,4,"Vygotsky ’ s ( 1978 ) theories o ff er an optimal platform to examine multiage groupings during unstructured play and the naturally occurring interactions between children of di ff erent ages. He discusses the zone of proximal development (ZPD), de fi ned as  ‘ the dis- tance between the actual development level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers ’  (p. 86). According to Vygotsky ’ s theory, the more competent person ( ‘ expert ’ ) provides the less competent person ( ‘ novice ’ ) with support and guidance to achieve a task the novice would not be able to achieve without help. The older child in a mixed-age grouping during recess or shooting a basketball. Bodrova and Leong ( 2017 ) contend that ZDP concept needs to be expanded beyond the adult or experienced peer to include interactions in various social contexts. They note:  ‘ While multi-age groups with older children function- ing as play mentors used to be a common feature of the culture of childhood in many Western countries, today these kind of interactions are less and less common ’  (p. 66). Play is co-constructed by a child in interactions with other people and in mixed-age groups older children can serve as natural play mentors to younger ones."
Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,4,"Vygotsky ( 1978 ) based his theory on the ideas that children learn from one another who di ff er in age, ability, gender, and special needs. The Vygotskian view of play through a cultural-historical lens means that play typically emerges through social inter- actions with peers. In mixed-age unstructured play groupings older children often operate within the younger child ’ s zone of proximal development (ZPD). Sca ff olding occurs in mixed-age play as a way of supporting younger children to a level that makes games enjoyable and older children often do not provide more help than the younger children wants or needs (Gray,  2013 ). Play can lead to developmental accom- plishments of younger and older children as they interact with one another in the social environment of play."

Older children in mixed-age classroom settings learn patience and tolerance, while being role models to younger children. The younger children played in more complex ways and behaved more maturely (Goldman,  1981 , Howes & Farver,  1987 , Logue,"

Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,5,"Murphy et al. ( 2016 ) describes two settings in Northern Irish primary schools for chil- dren 3-to-6-years that implemented Golden Key principles. Golden Key principles include mixed age play, family involvement, meaningful lessons or events, di ff erentiated lessons for younger and older children, and pairing two teachers to ask children ques- tions. Integration of Vygotskian principles and the Golden Key principles of mixed- age play and enhanced home-school links resulted in improvements in children ’ s learn- ing and social interactions. Teachers reported improved social interactions of children ‘ that implied trust, care, and respect ’  (p.142). Mixed age play in a home-school family pedagogy resulted in older children looking after younger children and children ’ s feelings of being cousins in their school family play-groups. both age-mixed and age-segregated. They found that two-year-olds in mixed-aged pairs engage in more complex play. Findings demonstrated that  fi ve-year-olds played at the same advanced level when paired with two-year-olds, drawing the toddlers into their play by providing them with appropriate props and telling them how to use the props. These younger children engaged in cooperative, social, and pretend play with  fi ve- year-olds, beyond their capabilities with their own peers. Goldman ( 1981 ) found that both 3-and-4-year-olds in mixed-age preschools engaged in less parallel play as com- pared to associative or cooperative forms of play, relative to those children in same age classrooms. Logue ( 2006 ) reported a teacher research project on the interaction between toddlers and preschoolers in a small childcare center. The observations revealed aggressive behaviors, such as hitting, kicking, spitting, taking objects, and demanding objects, were reduced in multiage groups compared to behaviors in same-age groups. Children shared more objects and imitated language at higher rates in multiage groups compared to same age groups."
Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,5,"Positive social interactions are found in preschool classes, as well as in mixed-age groups with a wider age range. Gray and Feldman ( 2004 ) describe play and mix-age grouping in a school of children ages four to nineteen in Sudbury Valley School. They found older students served as role models and showed responsibility for their behaviors as role models. Further,  ‘ the interactions with older adolescents in the school often led children to act within their zone of proximal development ’  (p. 139). According to Gray ( 2011 ) mixed-age groupings allow older children the occasion to practice nurturing and leading. Older children can be the mature ones in the interactions and therefore bene fi t by practicing their nurturance and leadership, demonstrating more kindness and compassion toward children who are at least three years younger than themselves."

The mixed-age group (K-2) engaged in a larger amount of collaborative literacy than the same-age group of kindergarten children. The combination of literacy experts with literacy novices increased the literacy experiences in the sociodramatic play center.
Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,6,"While many studies have found bene fi ts for all children, some longitudinal studies (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliams,  1993 , Moller, Forbes-Jones, & Hightower,  2008 , Winsler et al.,  2002 ) have found that younger children may bene fi t more from a mixed-age classroom environment than older children. Bailey et al. ( 1993 ) discovered that children in the mixed-age classes scored higher than children in the same age classes between 2-and-4 years of age, but the trend reversed for the oldest children. Winsler et al. ’ s ( 2002 ) studied sustained attention, social a ffi liation, and a ff ect expression with 3-and-4-year-olds. Findings suggest that 3-year-olds did better in mixed-age class- rooms but over time, 4-year-olds were less focused and task oriented. Children of both ages demonstrated signi fi cantly more positive e ff ects such as laughter and smiles in mixed-age classrooms.

There appear to be bene fi ts to mixed-age grouping in play contexts, as well as in classrooms with toddlers, preschool, and school-age children. The empirical studies suggest possible costs for older children in classrooms, but Gray ’ s ( 2013 ) extensive qualitative data on interactions between adolescents (ages 12 – 19) and children (ages 4 – 11) seem to demonstrate that the  ‘ advantages of age mixing go in both directions ’  (p. 197)."

Recess followed lunch, which had three grades together. Beresin ( 2010 ) focused on lunch/recess of grades 3-to-6 (personal email communication, Beresin, 25 August 2019). Beresin ( 2010 ) describes how mixed-age children, beyond the surveil- lance of adults, create stories, rhymes, songs, and games such as hop-scotch, wrestling, and basketball. Audio and video-taped student interviews and commentaries of social interactions document the ways children negotiated such things as taking turns, using space, and making friends. Mixed-age recess for ethnically diverse elementary school children provided a powerful space for learning how to form friendships and social networks."
Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,7,"Outside of a school setting, multiage outdoor settings also take place on adventure playgrounds and neighborhoods. Adventure playgrounds have roots in the principles of Playwork in the United Kingdom (Brown & Taylor,  2008 , Wilson,  2010 ). Playwork is a child-centered approach to outdoor play with mixed-age groupings. It is a pro- fessional, nondirective, and re fl ective approach supported by playworkers in schools, parks and a range of other settings (Brown,  2009 ). Adventure playgrounds provide free multi-age play spaces to help children develop creativity and confidence. There is minimal adult supervision, and a wide range of culturally diverse, mixed-aged children by their agenda. According to Wilson ( 2010 ),  ‘ Playworkers leave the children free to play for themselves but intervene in carefully measured ways to support the play process ’ (p. 9). Both older and younger children bene fi t from play on adventure playgrounds. Older children take on the role of tutor, nurturer, and mediator of con fl icts while Both older and younger children are challenged and learn to take risks as they socially interact with recycled materials, often called loose parts."
Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,7,"Adults sometimes feel anxious about children ’ s safety in mixed-age play environments (Play Safety Forum,  2017 , Skenazy,  2010 ). This can also be true of teachers that work in mixed-aged classes (Button & Wilde,  2019 , Rouse,  2015 ). For example, Rouse ( 2015 ) found that sta ff at an Australian daycare center reported positive social learning outcomes of mixing ages such as empathy, caring, risk taking, and resilience, but pre- ferred segregating children under 2 years of age from preschool children for safety pre- cautions. Button and Wilde ( 2019 ) found similar concerns in their study of Forest School practitioners and their attitudes toward the risk of delivering mixed-age outdoor play ses- sions. Forest Schools are  ‘ child centered, adult-facilitated, and play-based with access to woodland ’  (Button & Wilde,  2019 , p. 26). Sta ff were initially concerned about risky play in the woodlands before delivering sessions to multiage children, however, they were able to justify the developmental and emotional bene fi ts of children working and learning outdoors in mixed-age groupings."
Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,8,"Several studies (Byrnes, Shuster, & Jones,  1994 , Edwards, Blaise, & Hammer,  2009 , McClellan & Kinsey,  1999 ) have examined parents ’  as well as teachers ’  and children ’ s perceptions of social behaviors in mixed-aged classrooms. Byrnes et al. ( 1994 ) surveyed the attitudes of children and parents in a multiage primary level (ages 6-8) program. The parents felt positively about the multiage structure as well as the social and academic pro- gress their children made. Parents did have concerns that older and/or gifted children were not adequately challenged. The students had similar views. Some children preferred graded classrooms and expressed concerns about  ‘ helping younger children too much ’ (Byrnes et al.,  1994 , p. 20). Teachers ’  perceptions of preschool mixed-aged groupings from a post-developmental framework was explored to investigate complexities and issues associated with multiage grouping (Edwards et al.,  2009 ). The teachers understood ‘ multiage grouping as supporting children ’ s learning, assisting children in the manage- ment of positive peer group relations, and reducing the stress of working in chronologi- cally-based groupings ’  (p.6). McClellan and Kinsey ( 1999 ) used a teacher rating scale to examine children ’ s social behaviors in 29 multiage classrooms in  fi rst-to- fi fth-grades. Sixty- fi ve percent were from middle-income families, and thirty- fi ve percent were from low-income homes. The results suggested a signi fi cant positive e ff ect on prosocial behaviors speci fi cally aggressive prosocial friendship behaviors. Teachers noted fewer children experienced social isolation, and aggressive behaviors were signi fi cantly less in mixed-aged classroom."

However,   there   is   little understanding   of   the mech-   anisms that   link age   composition   to   children’s   development.   In   this study,   we   examined the   extent   to   which classroom   age composition   shaped children’s   classroom engagement,   as   well   as   the mediating   role   of   classroom engagement   in   the links   between classroom   age composition   and children’s   language and   literacy gains.

Specifically,   4-year-olds   in   classrooms with   a   greater number   of   younger classmates   experienced less   positive engagement   with their   teachers,   which   in   turn,   contributed   to   smaller vocabulary   gains across   the year.   In   addition,   being with   a   greater number   of   older classmates   was associated   with lower   negative engagement   in   the classroom.

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,1,"Despite the   importance   of   classroom engagement   for children’s   overall classroom   experience,   little   is   known about   what predicts   preschoolers’   engagement.   From   a   developmental-ecological per-   spective,   one possible   driver   at   the classroom   level   is   the age   com-   position   of   children   in   the classroom.   Classroom age   composition   imposes different   demands   on   teachers’   provisions   of   instruction   and activities,   and shapes   with whom   children interact   in   peer   play.   These factors   may influence   children’s   interpersonal dynam-   ics with   teachers and   peers,   as   well   as   their physical   interactions   with tasks.   Therefore,   this study   incorporates factors   across the   classroom-   and child-level and   seeks   to   examine the   extent   to   which:   (a)   classroom age   composition   is   associated with   4-year-   olds’   classroom engagement,   and   (b)   children’s   classroom engage-   ment mediates   associations between   classroom age   composition   and their   language and   literacy growth.

To   date,   however,   much   of   the focus   has been   on   the overall   structural and   process quality   of   classrooms   (e.g.,   CLASS and   ECERS,   Early,   Sideris,   Neitzel,   LaForett   &   Nehler,   2018   ,   Pianta,   La   Paro   &   Hamre,   2008   ),   which tend   to   show only   weak   to   moderate associations   with chil-   dren’s   skills gains   (   Burchinal,   2018   ).   These patterns   of   weak   to   moderate associations   are perhaps   not surprising   because individ-   ual children   experience the   classroom differently.   Put another   way,   the degree   to   which children   benefit from   high quality   classrooms   is,   at   least   in   part,   driven   by   how they   engage with   the classroom   setting   (   Howes,   20   0   0   ).   In   support   of   these assertions,   an   emerging   body   of   research suggests   that children’s   individual experiences,   including the   amount and   type   of   teacher instruction   and inter-   actions with   teachers,   vary greatly   among children   in   the same   classroom   (   Connor   et   al.,   2009   ,   Pelatti,   Piasta,   Justice,   &   O’Connell,   2014   ,   Sawyer   et   al.,   2018   ).   For example,   Connor   et   al.

The amount   of   variance   in   children’s   individual classroom   experience may   be   especially large   in   preschool given   that preschoolers   spend   a   significant amount   of   example,   Vitiello,   Booren,   Downer and   Williford   (2012)   found that   7%–23%   of   the variance   in   preschoolers’   classroom experiences   was   attributable   to   differences between   children,   which was   compara-   ble   to   the variance   at   the classroom   level   (i.e.,   3%–22%).   As   such,   the present   study moves   beyond the   ‘average’   classroom experi-   ence and   focuses   on   children’s   individualized experience   of   class-   room process   quality—their engagement   in   the classroom."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"According   to   Piaget   (1983)   and Vygotsky   (1978)   ,   children’s   de-   velopment   is   embedded   in   their social   interactions with   their   teacher and   peers   in   conjunction with   their physical   interac-   tions with   objects,   which are   the main   resources and   mechanisms   through which   children achieve   higher-level skills.   Importantly,   the   ways   in   which children   engage with   their teachers,   peers,   and   tasks can   be   either both   positive   or   negative   (   McEvoy,   Estrem,   Rodriguez,   &   Olson,   2003   ).   As   such,   prior studies   have concep-   tualized children’s   classroom engagement   as   4   distinct constructs   (   Bohlmann   &   Downer,   2016   ,   Sabol   et   al.,   2018   ).   The first   dimen-   sion,   positive engagement   with teachers,   captures children’s   emo-   tional connection   and communication   with their   teacher,   such   as   the degree   to   which children   seek proximity   to   their teachers.   The second   dimension,   positive engagement   with peers,   refers   to   children’s   initiation and   maintenance   of   positive interactions   with   classmates,   including their   successful initiation   of   conversation and   play.   The third   dimension,   positive engagement   with tasks,   taps   into the   degree   to   which children   orient themselves   toward class-   room activities,   such   as   remaining focused   on   an   activity for   an   extended period.   Finally,   the fourth   and final   dimension,   negative   classroom engagement,   includes children’s   conflict with   teachers   and peers   and their   display   of   off-task and   dysregulated behaviors   (   Downer   et   al.,   2010   ).   Taken together,   these   4   aspects   of   engage-   ment collectively   reflect the   ways   in   which children   engage with,   and experience,   the classroom   setting."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"Underscoring the   importance   of   children’s   classroom engage-   ment,   previous studies   have shown   that both   children’s   positive   and negative   engagement with   teachers,   peers,   and tasks   are each   uniquely predictive   of   their early   school success,   including their   language and   literacy development   (   Bohlmann   &   Downer,   2016   ,   Sabol   et   al.,   2018   ,   Vitiello   &   Williford,   2016   ).

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"children’s   language and   literacy learning   through distinct,   albeit   overlapping ways.   For example,   children who   engage more   pos-   itively with   their teachers   and peers   have been   found   to   have   more positive   relationships and   experience more   dyadic conversa-   tions,   richer language   use,   and more   individualized learning   than   children who   engage with   their teacher   and peers   less positively   (   Hartz,   Williford,   &   Koomen,   2017   ,   Justice,   McGinty,   Zucker,   Ca-   bell,   &   Piasta,   2013   ).   These outcomes   are key   for children’s   lan-   guage and   literacy learning   (   Cabell,   Justice,   McGinty,   DeCoster,   &   Forston,   2015   ,   Sabol   et   al.,   2018   ).   As   another example,   children’s   sustained engagement   with tasks   and self-regulated learning,   facil-   itate their   efficiency   of   internalizing language   and literacy   knowl-   edge   (   Bohlmann   &   Downer,   2016   ,   Vitiello   &   Williford,   2016   ).   In   contrast,   children’s   negative engagement   with teachers,   peers,   and   tasks has   been found   to   result   in   fewer opportunities   for children   to   participate   in   activities that   involve explicit   or   implicit language   and literacy   learning   (   Sabol   et   al.,   2018   ,   Williford,   Maier,   Downer,   Pianta,   &   Howes,   2013   ).   The above-reviewed information   suggests   that children’s   classroom engagement   is   a   multi-dimensional con-   cept that   reflects essential   aspects   of   children’s   individual class-   room experiences   and plays   a   critical role   in   their later   language   and literacy   development."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"Despite the   important role   of   children’s   classroom engage-   ment for   their language   and literacy   development   (   Bohlmann   &   Downer,   2016   ,   Sabol   et   al.,   2018   ,   Vitiello   &   Williford,   2016   ),   we   know relatively   little about   what predicts   classroom engagement   (   Vitiello   &   Williford,   2020   ,   Vitiello   et   al.,   2012   ).   In   this study,   we   examine the   role   of   classroom age   composition and   opera-   tionalize   it   as   the proportion   of   children   in   different age   groups   at   the classroom   level.   We   focus   on   this aspect   of   the class-   room setting   as   a   predictor   of   children’s   engagement for   2   rea-   sons.   First,   unlike   K-12,   preschool classrooms   often serve   chil-   dren   of   multiple age   groups.   According   to   the national   statistics,   47   states allow   preschool programs   to   have mixed-age group-   ings,   and roughly   75%   of   Head Start   classrooms are   mixed-age   (   Moiduddin,   Aikens,   Tarullo,   West,   &   Xue,   2012   ,   National Center   on   Child Care   Quality Improvement   &   National Association   for   Regulatory Administration,   2015   ).   These states   provide varied   re-   quirements about   the expected   number   of   children   in   each age   group and   teacher-child ratios,   which may   contribute   to   hetero-   geneity   in   the distribution   of   children   in   different age   groups doc-   recent work   has shown   that the   mixture   of   ages within   preschool   classrooms has   implications for   both teachers’   classroom prac-   tices and   children’s   early learning   (   Ansari   et   al.,   2016   ,   Bell,   Green-   field,   &   Bulotsky-Shearer,   2013   ,   Moller,   Forbes-Jones   &   Hightower,   gan,   2019   ).   For example,   4-year-olds who   were enrolled   in   class-   rooms with   more   3-year-olds demonstrated   smaller gains   in   aca-   demic skills   (   Ansari   et   al.,   2016   ).   Notwithstanding the   widespread   use   of   mixed-age classrooms   and its   connection with   children’s   early learning,   we   know little   about what   is   needed   to   ensure that   mixed-age classrooms   successfully meet   the needs   of   all children.   Thus,   this study   aimed   to   fill this   knowledge gap   by   examining   children’s   classroom engagement   as   a   potential mechanism.   Below,   we   highlight evidence   that suggests   age composition   may play   a   role   in   all   4   types   of   classroom engagement."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"First,   the variation   in   children’s   needs resulting   from mixed-age   classrooms may   alter the   quality   of   teachers’   instructional practices   and teacher-child interactions,   which directly   predicts children’s   engagement with   their teacher   (   Vitiello   &   Williford,   2020   ).   For   ex-   ample,   teachers   in   mixed-age classrooms   are more   likely   to   ex-"
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"perience challenges   in   providing age-appropriate literacy   stimula-   tion and   didactic instruction   (   Ansari,   2017   ).   These challenges   expe-   rienced   by   teachers may,   in   part,   be   due   to   younger children   hav-   ing relatively   lower skills   on   average,   which results   in   the exposure   to   less effective   instruction for   older children   in   the same   class-   room   (   Wilkinson   &   Fung,   2002   ,   Yeomans-Maldonado   et   al.,   2019   ).   In   particular,   this may   reduce exposure   to   richness and   variabil-   ity   in   vocabulary and   syntactic structure   (   Huttenlocher,   Vasilyeva,   Cymerman,   &   Levine,   2002   ).   Furthermore,   studies examining   inter-   actional quality   conclude that   teachers who   teach younger   children   or   teach   in   more age-diverse settings   display lower-quality interac-   tions   (   Ansari   &   Pianta,   2019   ,   Kuger,   Kluczniok,   Kaplan,   &   Rossbach,   2016   )   but engage   in   more positive   interactions with   older and   better-behaved children   (   Vitiello   et   al.,   2012   ).   Therefore,   we   hy-   pothesize that   children   in   classrooms with   more older   peers would   have more   positive engagement   with teachers   compared with   chil-   dren   in   classrooms with   more younger   peers."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"Classroom age   composition may   also explain   variation   in   chil-   dren’s   engagement with   peers.   Developmental studies   have long   shown that   the level   of   children’s   language and   literacy abilities,   as   well   as   social-emotional skills,   largely depend   on   children’s   age   (   Skibbe,   Montroy,   Bowles,   &   Morrison,   2019   ).   As   such,   children   en-   rolled   in   classrooms with   a   higher percentage   of   older children   are   more likely   to   have interactions   with peers   who have   higher lev-   els   of   language skills   and greater   peer language   resources   (   Henry   &   Rickman,   2007   ),   which   in   turn,   contributes   to   more positive   en-   gagement with   peers.   In   addition,   being with   older peers   may pro-   vide younger   children with   more opportunities   to   learn and   un-   derstand others’   thoughts and   use socially   desirable strategies   to   approach peers   (   Bandura,   1986   ,   Park   &   Lee,   2015   ).   With that   said,   however,   previous studies   have suggested   that   a   lack   of   same-aged   classmates for   the oldest   children   in   a   classroom was   associated   with fewer   positive peer   interactions   (   Slot   &   Bleses,   2018   ).   Thus,   it   is   likely that   more positive   engagement with   peers will   occur   in   classrooms with   more older   peers than   younger peers."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"Classroom age   composition may   also influence   children’s   en-   gagement with   tasks.   As   illustrated earlier,   the average   age and   skills   of   children   in   the classroom   may shape   teachers’   provision   of   tasks and   instructional support   (   Yeomans-Maldonado   et   al.,   2019   ),   which may   further influence   how well   children maintain   focus and   engage   in   self-directed learning   (   Strati,   Schmidt,   &   Maier,   2017   ).   Both the   provision   of   developmentally age-appropriate tasks   and   quality instructional   support   in   the classroom   are likely   to   fos-   ter children’s   engagement with   classroom tasks.   However,   a   larger   range   of   ages   in   the classroom   poses challenges   for teachers   to   pro-   vide individualized   tasks and   instructional support   (   Ansari,   2017   ).   Ansari   (2021)   showed that   teachers   in   mixed-age classrooms   serv-   ing   a   larger number   of   younger children   provided fewer   writing   materials and   books   on   average.   In   addition,   the above-mentioned   interpersonal dynamics   with teachers   and peers   resulting from   classroom age   composition may   also ensure   emotional security   that allows   children   to   better engage   in   tasks   (   Alamos   &   Willi-   ford,   2020   ).   Hence,   we   postulate that   children   in   classrooms with   more older   peers may   display more   positive engagement   with   tasks   as   compared with   children   in   classrooms with   more younger   peers."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"Lastly,   age composition   may also   influence children’s   early   learning through   children’s   negative classroom   engagement.   As   mentioned above,   classroom age   composition overlaps   with the   average levels   of   language and   self-regulation skills   as   well   as   skill diversity   in   the classroom,   which can   shape the   amount   of   conflict children   have with   teachers and   peers and   the   de-   gree   of   behavioral dysregulation   during activities.   On   the one   hand,   children   at   different ages   display various   emotional regu-   lation and   social skills   (   Skibbe   et   al.,   2019   ),   which are   associ-"

Earlier studies   comparing the   incidence   of   peer conflict   among different   age groups   indicate less   frequent   peer conflict   and more   child-generated resolution   occurring among   older age   groups   (   Chen,   Fein,   Killen,   &   Tam,   2001   ,   Raikes,   Virmani,   Thompson   &   Hatton,   2013   ).   On   the other   hand,   dealing with   multi-   sensitive and   responsive   to   individual needs   (   Ansari   &   Pianta,   2019   ,   ity emotional   and instructional   support may   lead children   to   dis-   play more   off-task behaviors   due   to   the lack   of   emotional security   they experience   (   Alamos   &   Williford,   2020   ).   The lack   of   responsiv-   ity from   teachers may   even lead   children   to   display disruptive   be-   haviors   to   draw their   teacher’s   attention   (   Curby,   Downer,   &   Booren,   2014   ).   Accordingly,   in   the present   study,   we   expect that   being   in   a   classroom with   more older   peers   is   associated with   less negative   engagement than   being   in   a   classroom with   a   higher proportion   of   younger peers."
Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"The extant   literature reviewed   above suggests   that being   around   older classmates   may facilitate   positive classroom   engagement   and reduce   negative engagement,   which may   then translate   into   larger gains   in   language and   literacy skills   for children.   Studies   have documented   that classroom   age composition,   as   measured   by   the proportion   of   younger classmates   or   variability/range   of   chil-   dren’s   age   in   the classroom,   are associated   with children’s   lan-   guage and   literacy development   (   Ansari   et   al.,   2016   ,   Justice,   Lo-   ample,   Ansari   et   al.   (2016)   found that   4-year-old preschoolers   dis-   play smaller   gains   in   language and   literacy skills   in   classrooms   with   a   larger proportion   of   3-year-olds,   and these   negative associa-   tions are   equal   to   roughly   2   to   5   months   of   academic development.   Despite these   documented associations,   the mechanisms   through   which classroom   age composition   contribute   to   children’s   language   and literacy   gains are   not yet   well-understood.   Given the   possi-   ble influence   of   classroom age   composition   on   children’s   class-   room engagement   and classroom   engagement   on   language and   lit-   eracy learning,   we   test the   mediating role   of   classroom engage-   ment   in   the association   between classroom   age composition   and   preschoolers’   language and   literacy gains.   Due   to   data limitations   and the   fact that   classroom age   composition may   matter differ-   entially for   children   at   different age   groups   (   Ansari   et   al.,   2016   ,   Moller   et   al.,   2008   ),   we   focus   on   the experiences   of   4-year-olds   in   mixed-age classrooms   to   unpack the   mechanisms that   link class-   room age   composition with   children’s   language and   literacy devel-   opment.

However, a recent national analy- sis of Head Start classrooms found sizeable negative asso- ciations between mixed-age education and 4-year-olds’  academic learning (Ansari et al., 2016). Surprisingly, we  know little about how other classroom and teacher charac- teristics might modify the influence of age composition.

Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,1,"Whether implemented for pedagogical or logistical rea- sons, mixed-age classrooms have a long history in preschool,  and much of the initial support for this educational model  comes from Vygotskian theory, which posits that children  learn from their peers (Vygotsky, 1978). Indeed, mixed-age  age classrooms provide younger children the opportunity to  model behaviors their older peers exhibit and provide older  students with opportunities to scaffold and teach their  younger classmates (Lillard, 2016, Winsler et  al., 2002).  Mixed-age classrooms also provide students with a greater  range of interactions, which is often argued to facilitate the  development of a wide range of social skills, including  empathy and self-regulation (Lillard, 2016). However,  recent studies do not support the notion that mixed-age  classrooms are beneficial for older children (Ansari et al.,  2016, Moller et al., 2008). These documented negative asso- ciations between mixed-age classrooms and the learning of  the older students in the classroom may in part be due to the  additional challenges teachers may encounter when working  with children of greater age diversity.

Building  on prior research, this study examines whether the association between classroom age composition and children’s learning  and development vary based on classroom quality and teacher characteristics using a subset of the Family and Child  Experiences Survey (FACES), a nationally representative sample of 3- and 4-year-old children attending Head Start  ( n  = 2,829). Results revealed that the association between age composition and children’s academic skills was dependent on  classroom quality and that classroom quality was less predictive of children’s skills in mixed-age classrooms. Teacher educa- tion but not experience also moderated the influence of age composition such that mixed-age classrooms taught by a teacher  with higher education were not associated with decreased literacy gains among older children."

Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"To explore these questions, we use a bioecological lens  (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) and focus on interactions  between children and their proximal classroom context.  From this, we propose that children’s academic and social- behavioral development in the preschool years is shaped by  both features of their preschool context and their own indi- vidual characteristics. Specifically, we focus on interactions  between two contextual characteristics of the classroom: the  ages of one’s classmates and the observed quality of the  classroom and teacher (as defined by their qualifications).  Importantly, we hypothesize that the influence of these inter- actions varies by children’s own age, which is recognized as  a “person” characteristic (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006)  or a referent status in other peer effects research (Justice,  Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn, 2011). For example,  a 3-year-old may be positively influenced by the presence of  older, more skilled peers regardless of the quality of the  classroom they are in, whereas a 4-year-old may need par- ticular contextual supports to demonstrate academic growth  when in a classroom with younger peers.

To  begin, there is substantial evidence that suggests that the  classroom quality is an important feature of early child- hood programs (Keys et al., 2013, Mashburn et al., 2008).  In general, classroom quality focuses on two domains:  structural quality and process quality. Current research  suggests that structural quality, which includes factors such  as leadership within the preschool, teacher qualifications,  and child-adult ratios, is necessary but not enough to pro- duce optimal environments for children to learn and  develop in (Burchinal, 2017)."
Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"On the other hand, process quality, which captures teach- ers’ social, emotional, and instructional interactions with  their students (Howes et al., 2008, Pianta et al., 2005), has  been documented as a critical aspect of children’s early edu- cational experiences (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008). For  example, a large-scale study of pre-kindergarten programs  from across the country found that measures of process"
Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"quality were more strongly associated with children’s gains  in language, literacy, and social development compared with  numerous indicators of structural quality (Howes et  al.,  2008). Because process quality captures the experiential  aspect of preschool, including the instruction a child receives  and the supportiveness of their teacher, it may modify the  associations between age composition and children’s learn- ing and development. Specifically, higher quality teacher- child interactions may be indicative of classrooms that are  more effectively meeting the needs of young children of dif- ferent ages (e.g., scaffolding, individual time), whereas  lower quality classrooms may be indicative of teachers who  are struggling. Thus, higher quality classrooms may alter  children’s classrooms experiences in mixed-age classrooms,  such as their interactions with their teachers and peers,  which prior studies suggest has implications for children’s  school success (Henry & Rickman, 2007, Howes et  al.,  2008, Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014, Mashburn,  Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009)."
Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"In support of these notions, an exploratory study by  Guo, Tompkins, Justice, and Petscher (2014) found that  mixed-age preschool programs can be beneficial when  coupled with high-quality teacher-child interactions. In  this study, vocabulary development among 130 preschool  children in 16 classrooms was examined. Children in class- rooms with wider age variance demonstrated larger gains  in vocabulary across the year. This association was stron- ger for the younger children in the classroom and notably,  was stronger when the classroom was of higher quality.  Presumably, children in high-quality classrooms have more  opportunities to have meaningful interactions with their  teacher and peers, both of which may enhance the experi- ence of being in a mixed-age environment. The quality of  the classroom may thus change the effects of age composi- tion, although it has rarely been examined in this context.  However, other related work from Tulsa’s pre-K programs  has revealed that there is a large degree of variation in  pre-K impacts more generally as a function of classroom  instructional quality (Johnson, Markowitz, Hill, & Phillips,  2016), which supports the general notions discussed  previously."
Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"Next, managing a classroom with children of different  ages and meeting the diverse needs of children is a challeng- ing task for teachers (Guo et al., 2014). Even so, it may be  that teachers with more education and experience are better  prepared for the challenge and have the expertise that enables  them to manage the classroom effectively and implement  activities and instruction that are beneficial for all children  in the classroom. For example, older research has docu- mented both positive and negative associations between"

Variations in these types of activities as well as  other teacher-influenced classroom attributes, such as the  amount of instructional time, may change the way age com- position influences children’s development. Although pre- school teachers’ education and experience have demonstrated  few links to measures of classroom quality (Early et  al.,  2007), they have shown modest associations with growth in  children’s learning and development (Howes et al., 2008).  Furthermore, it may be that the skills gained through prior  education and experience provide a specific boost for teach- ers in mixed-age classrooms. These teachers may have more  specific strategies, not captured in global quality measures,  that enable them to promote development among all children  in the classroom such as ways to assign roles in group work  that maximize the potential learning opportunities for chil- dren of different ages. In other words, teachers with more  education and experience may be better equipped to create a  positive, developmentally appropriate, mixed-age classroom  than less educated and experienced teachers."
Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,3,"In particular, there are a number of aspects of teaching  that are not well captured in current measures of quality but  may be particularly important in mixed-age contexts  (Burchinal, 2017). For example, teachers’ ability to differen- tiate their instruction to match student needs is an important  aspect of children’s classroom experiences, but many teach- ers do not feel confident about their ability to do so effec- tively (Manship, Farber, Smith, & Drummond, 2016). The  importance of differentiation may be magnified in mixed- age classrooms as children’s skills are likely to be more vari- able than in same-age classrooms. Accordingly, we  hypothesize that teachers’ education and experience may  change children’s experiences in mixed-age preschool set- tings because they may capture the degree to which teachers  are more comfortable with specific practices, such as effec- tive differentiation, that are especially necessary in the con- text of classrooms that are more age diverse."

We build on the work of Ansari and colleagues (2016)  and examine these associations in the Family and Child  Experiences Survey (FACES) 2009 data set, a nationally  representative sample of Head Start children and classrooms.  In their work, Ansari and colleagues found that: (a) 4-year- olds in classrooms with a higher proportion of 3-year-olds  experienced fewer gains in literacy and math skills com- pared with 4-year-olds in classrooms with fewer 3-year-olds,"

Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,3,"As part of the current study, we hypothesized that these  direct influences of classroom age composition would vary  based on the quality of preschool classrooms, specifically,  the negative associations previously documented between  higher proportions of 3-year-olds in the classroom and  4-year-olds’ academic gains would only be seen in class- rooms of low quality. We also hypothesized that benefits  may emerge for 3-year-olds in mixed-age classrooms when  classrooms were of high quality as this may provide an  opportunity for high-quality interactions with older and  more skilled peers. With regards to teacher education and  experience, we expected that the negative associations  between age composition and 4-year-olds’ academic devel- opment would be reduced in classrooms with more edu- cated and experienced teachers. Thus, when taken together,  this study sought to examine specific, policy-amenable  characteristics of mixed-age classrooms that may result in  age composition being more or less promotive of children’s  early learning and development. By examining a national  sample of preschoolers, we are able to document the spe- cific conditions under which mixed-age classrooms are  most beneficial and least harmful to the development of  preschoolers."

Results suggest that a greater number of younger classmates did not detract from 4-year-olds ’  language development, literacy performance, or inhibitory control, nor did hav- ing older peers consistently facilitate learning in these domains. However, 4-year-olds who entered school with low inhibitory control and print knowledge demonstrated greater gains in both domains when attending classrooms with more same-age or older classmates than when in class- rooms with more younger peers. When taken together, these results suggest that classroom age composition, in prekindergarten programs serving mostly 4-year-olds, for the most part has little consequence except for those 4-year-olds entering school with lower skill levels in key domains, in which case having older peers is of benefit."
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,2,"The growing recognition of early childhood as a critical developmental period that has lasting influences has laid the groundwork for the expansion of preschool education for both 3- and 4-year-olds across the country (Duncan & Magnuson,  2013 , Yoshikawa et al.,  2013 ). Indeed, recent national estimates suggest that roughly 42% and 68% of 3- and 4-year-olds, respectively, attend preschool during the year before kindergarten, which is greater than enrollment rates"
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,2,"respectively, Department of Education,  2015 ). This expansion of pre- school stems from the fact that these programs not only facilitate children ’ s school preparedness, but have also been found to narrow developmental disparities throughout the life course (Sorensen & Dodge,  2015 , Vandell, Burchinal, & Pierce,  2016 ). With the promise of preschool coupled with its continued expansion, there has been growing interest in understanding the drivers of how these programs impact children (Duncan & Magnuson,  2013 ). One such aspect of among both researchers and policymakers is age compos- ition, in large part because programs often regulate access by age. Notwithstanding these regulations, as preschool expands and Head Start and state prekindergarten (preK) funds are more often used to serve children in common classrooms (i.e., the blending/braiding of local, state, and federal funds), an increasing number of 3-years-olds are being served in classrooms with 4-year-olds, making class- rooms that enroll different age children a more prevalent experience for preschoolers across the country (Ansari, Education,  2012 )."
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,2,"Despite the increasing number of programs serving dif- ferent age children, the implications of classroom age com- support (Mason & Burns,  1996 , Veenman,  1995 ). These equivocal findings, coupled with the widespread prevalence of these types of classrooms in many publicly funded pre- kindergarten programs in the United States (Ansari et al., 2016 , Bell et al.,  2013 , Moller, Forbes-Jones, & Hightower, 2008 ), suggest an imperative to document the possible con- sequences for student learning of this policy for preschool eligibility and enrollment which some research suggests could be potentially undermining its overall effectiveness (Ansari et al.,  2016 , Moller et al.,  2008 ). Toward that end, as part of the present investigation we addresses the potential benefits and drawbacks of having different age peers in preK classrooms across eight states that serve different age chil- dren in the same classrooms (roughly 12% of 3-year-olds in these states are served by public programs, Barnett, Epstein, Sansanelli, & Hustedt,  2009 , Barnett et al.,  2010 ).

Nested within this bioecological framework,"
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"theories of social learning (Bandura,  1986 ) and cognitive development (Vygotsky,  1978 ) also guide our investigation, as they both contend that interactions between children and their peers (i.e., peer effects) can be one of the primary mechanisms through which classroom experience affects students ’  development. For example, these theories suggest that, in a classroom ecology, higher-skilled (or older) chil- dren can  directly promote the early learning and develop- ment of their lower-skilled (or younger) peers and, in so child-by-child transmission). In support of these theoretical arguments laid out by Bandura ( 1986 ) and Vygotsky ( 1978 ), a number of studies have found that children ’ s classmates do shape their individual development (Henry & Rickman, 2007 , Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek,  2014 , Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta,  2009 , Yudron, Jones, & Raver, 2014 ). At the same time, however, other developmental and educational scholars suggest that there is considerable more nuance to the peer ecology and that careful attention should be paid to the individual characteristics of children and their families (e.g., Ribeiro, Zachrisson, & Dearing,  2017 ) and the ways in which the peer ecology intersects with various other aspects of the classroom environment (e.g., Guo, Tompkins,"
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"Although less often discussed, it is also plausible that the age composition of the classroom affects children through indirect means, such as effects on teacher-child interactions (i.e., child-to-teacher-to-child transmission, Ansari & Pianta, 2018 , Snell, Hindman, & Belsky,  2015 ). Indeed, teachers in classrooms with greater age heterogeneity (e.g., 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds) are faced with challenges that include adjusting instruction to a wider range of skill levels relative to class- rooms that have a more uniform age level (e.g., only 4-year- olds), and at the upper and lower ends of the age distribu- tion this could impact children if teachers cannot address this demand. Accordingly, theories of the peer ecology of effects on children ’ s early school performance and may shape one of the primary pathways through which preschool programs impact children (see also, Henry & Rickman, 2007 , Justice et al.,  2014 , Mashburn et al.,  2009 , Yudron et al.,  2014 ). Regardless of whether these pathways are direct or indirect, it is important to note that, in the present inves- tigation, we focus on the intersection of child age and skill, whereas much of the peer effects literature has focused on skill alone, which is confounded with age."
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"In light of the expansion of preschool education across the United States, particularly in the form of state-funded pre- kindergarten programs and braided/blended funding for early childhood education, there is a great deal of heterogen- eity in the ages of children served within programs and classrooms (Duncan & Magnuson,  2013 , Yoshikawa et al., 2013 ). Some programs serve only 3- or only 4-year-olds, whereas many early childhood classrooms serve children whose ages may span several years (e.g., 3-, 4-, and 5-year-"

Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"Despite these conflicting claims, three recent large-scale studies of classroom age composition are of note, all of which were done in publicly funded programs. First, Moller et al. ( 2008 ), who sampled 4-year-old children from urban preschool programs in the northeastern United States, found that greater heterogeneity in classroom age composition was associated with less optimal school achievement. The nega- tive associations between age heterogeneity and child devel- opment were strongest for the oldest children in the classroom. Second, a recent nationally representative study of classrooms in Head Start revealed that 4-year-olds dis- played fewer gains in areas of early mathematics and lan- guage and literacy when they attended classrooms with a greater number of 3-year-olds (Ansari et al.,  2016 ), with effect sizes in some classrooms corresponding to approxi- mately 4 – 5 months of development. Both studies also docu- mented no consistent benefits of having older classmates for the school performance of the youngest children in the classroom (Ansari et al.,  2016 , Moller et al.,  2008 ), suggest- ing that careful attention must be paid to the older children in these environments. Finally, in contrast to the aforemen- tioned studies, Bell et al. ( 2013 ) found that, regardless of children ’ s"
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"federally funded preschool programs in the southeastern United States did not have any implications for children ’ s academic or socio-emotional development. Thus, when taken together, these three studies — which represent some of the most rigor- ous assessments of the age composition of general preK classrooms — provide inconclusive evidence regarding the implications of having different age classmates."
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"It should also be noted that much of this existing litera- ture on classroom age composition has examined the experi- ences of children in classrooms with a limited age range. For example, the work done by both Ansari et al. ( 2016 ) and Bell et al. ( 2013 ) provided a limited contrast of different age children, spanning roughly 12 months. That is, in class- rooms with a limited age range of children, the study partic- ipants are generally either the youngest or oldest children in the classroom in any given year. In light of the literature and theoretical arguments underpinning peer effects and child development more generally (e.g., Bandura,  1986 , Vygotsky,  1978 ), a more complete assessment of the implica- tions of age composition for children ’ s early learning is likely necessary. In fact, some educational scholars argue that having different age peers in the classroom is likely to be most effective when there are at least three-year age groupings (Lillard,  2016 ), thereby allowing children to be"

Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,4,"Given the conflicting claims related to classroom age composition effects, a number of studies have also empha- sized the role of children ’ s incoming skill levels, both as a potential moderator of classroom effects and as a means of disentangling the different ways in which classroom com- positional factors shape children ’ s early learning (for a related discussion, see Justice, Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn,  2011 , Mashburn et al.,  2009 ). Children ’ s own to understand the implications of classroom age composition because children ’ s skills and behaviors shape the ways in which children interact with their peers and teachers, and in turn, have implications for the ways in which classrooms impact children. In the context of mixed-aged classrooms, of particular importance are (a) children ’ s language/literacy skills, which enable them to communicate with their peers and teachers, and (b) their executive functioning, which allows children to manage their behavior and emotions (Duncan et al.,  2007 , Mashburn et al.,  2009 , Masten et al., 2012 , McClelland et al.,  2013 ). And in support of these very points, a number of studies have found that although lower- skilled children do learn more from their interactions with their older and more skilled peers, higher-skilled children are neither harmed by nor consistently benefit from their interactions with their classmates (Guo et al.,  2014 , Justice et al.,  2011 )."
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,4,"In light of the existing literature and current landscape of preschool education in the United States, this study sought to address a key question that is being considered by both researchers and policymakers alike: whether it is more effective to offer preschool programs that constrain the age range of children in classrooms (e.g., when only a 12-month span determines access) or allow for greater heterogeneity (such as programs for 4-year-olds that open eligibility to 3- year-olds). More specifically, we address the following two research questions for low-income children served in state- supported prekindergarten programs:"

However, given the equivocal nature of the existing literature discussed above, and lack of empirical work in this area looking at executive functioning in particular, we leave our study hypotheses as largely exploratory. Despite these efforts, it is important to acknow- ledge that our data prohibit us from examining the out- comes of 3-year-olds, nonetheless, understanding whether one group of children benefits from or is harmed by mixed- age environments remains an important endeavor as the goal of early childhood education is to ensure that all chil- dren reap the maximum benefit from these programs."

Understanding the implications of such expansion efforts  is of the utmost importance, as many programs, including  Head Start—the largest federally funded preschool pro- gram in the United States—often serve both 3- and  4-year-olds in the same classrooms.

Given the developmental differences between 3- and 4-year-olds, it  is unknown whether educating them together in the same classrooms benefits one group, both, or neither. Using data  from the Family and Child Experiences Survey 2009 cohort, this study used a peer-effects framework to examine the  associations between mixed-age classrooms and the school readiness of a nationally representative sample of newly  enrolled 3-year-olds ( n  = 1,644) and 4-year-olds ( n  = 1,185) in the Head Start program. Results revealed that 4-year- olds displayed fewer gains in academic skills during the preschool year when they were enrolled in classrooms with  more 3-year-olds, effect sizes corresponded to 4 to 5 months of academic development. In contrast, classroom age  composition was not consistently associated with 3-year-olds’ school readiness."

Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"These cognitive and social-learning theories underlie  the peer-effects framework (Henry & Rickman, 2007,  Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014, Mashburn, Justice,  Downer, & Pianta, 2009) that guides this study. In con- trast to the evidence on the effects of teachers on chil- dren, however, the literature on peer effects—and how  children’s learning is directly affected by their class- mates—is far shallower, especially during the preschool  years. Understanding the role of peer effects during this  period is critical because much of the classroom instruc- tion in early care and education programs occurs through  peer interactions and whole-group activities as opposed  to teacher-directed instruction (Ansari & Gershoff, 2015,  Mashburn et al., 2009). The omission of peer effects from  past evaluations of Head Start has left a critical gap in  knowledge. In fact, classroom age composition may be  one of the main reasons why the Head Start program has  been documented as less effective for older children than  for younger children (Jenkins, Farkas, Duncan, Burchinal,  & Vandell, 2015, Puma et al., 2010), although this possi- bility has yet to be tested."
Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"Prior research has suggested two primary reasons that  peer effects may be important in early childhood class- rooms. One is the direct-effects pathway (Justice et al.,  2014, Mashburn et al., 2009). In this pathway, children  are directly influenced by their peer’s abilities. From this  perspective, one would hypothesize that mixed-age  classrooms would be beneficial for younger children but  may be deleterious for the skill development of older  children. The second is an indirect-effects pathway,  whereby teachers modify their classroom practices to  accommodate a wide range of skill levels, which can lead  to less challenging content and potential disengagement  for older children (Urberg & Kaplan, 1986). This pathway  is particularly salient when considering children’s behav- ior, as having a wide range of behaviors in the classroom  or a high concentration of problem behaviors is challeng- ing for teachers to manage (Yudron, Jones, & Raver,  2014), therefore, teachers of mixed-age classrooms may  spend more time on classroom management than on  activities that facilitate children’s learning. While both of  these pathways for peer effects seem feasible, the evi- dence regarding mixed-age preschool classrooms has  been ambiguous, with some studies documenting posi- tive effects (Blasco, Bailey, & Burchinal, 1993, Goldman,  1981, Guo, Tompkins, Justice, & Petscher, 2014), and oth- ers documenting null or negative associations (Bell,  Greenfield, & Bulotsky-Shearer, 2013, Moller, Forbes- Jones, & Hightower, 2008, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986, Winsler  et al., 2002). Given the conflicting evidence, it remains  unclear whether children benefit from being in mixed- age versus restricted-age classrooms and, if there is an  advantage, whether this applies to younger or older  children."
Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"Recent studies that have tried to address these out- standing issues have been limited in a few notable ways.  First, these studies have not examined these processes  using a national data set, and, therefore, some of the con- flicting evidence may be the result of prior studies having  generally used small and localized samples (Blasco et al.,  1993, Goldman, 1981, Guo et  al., 2014, Winsler et  al.,  2002). Second, although two studies (Bell et  al., 2013,  Moller et al., 2008) provided much needed—albeit con- flicting—evidence on the potential outcomes of mixed- age classrooms for low-income children, they relied on  teachers’ reports of children’s academic skills. This is  problematic because these reports are likely to be biased  and reflect teachers’ perceptions of children’s abilities  relative to those of their classmates (Guo et  al., 2014,  Mashburn et al., 2009), which may be particularly con- two age cohorts of children. Third, researchers have usu- ally failed to control for other classroom processes and  selection factors, thus limiting their ability to draw firm  conclusions about class composition. Finally, although  restricted-age classrooms may be more effective than  mixed-age classrooms (Moller et  al., 2008), it may not  always be feasible to separately serve 3- and 4-year-olds  in all areas of the country (Veenman, 1995), in other  words, mixed-age classrooms are sometimes created out  of necessity. Thus, an additional scientific and policy  question that remains to be answered is whether there is  a threshold or tipping point at which the ratio of younger  to older students in mixed-age classrooms has a more  deleterious or positive effect for children."
Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"Our objective in the present investigation was to  address these gaps in knowledge by using data from the  Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2009  cohort to examine (a) whether classroom age composi- tion affects 3- and 4-year-olds’ school readiness and (b)  whether there is a threshold at which the associations  between classroom age composition and children’s  school readiness are stronger (or weaker). In addressing  these questions, we are poised to answer both a basic  developmental question regarding the role of peer effects  in early care and education programs as well as a policy  question regarding the implications of mixed-age class- rooms for Head Start children across the nation."

In this study ( N  ¼  130 chil- dren in 16 classrooms representing a subset of all children enrolled in these classrooms), results showed a significant cross-level interaction between classroom age composition and children’s age, suggesting positive effects of greater variance in classroom age composition for younger but not older children. The interaction between behavior management (1 dimension of classroom quality) and classroom age composition was also significant, indicating that a wider distribution of classroom age composition was positively related to children’s vocabulary gains within class- rooms characterized by better behavior management.  Practice or Policy:  Findings underscore the importance of children’s social interactions with more knowledgeable conversational partners in pro- moting their vocabulary development and signify the need to help teachers learn how to manage chil- dren’s behaviors so as to provide a classroom that is optimal for child learning."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,2,"Vocabulary development is often a focus of applied developmental research addressing early childhood programming because of its central importance to children’s school readiness and later academic achievement (e.g., Justice, Mashburn, Pence, & Wiggins, 2008, Wasik, Bond, & Hindman, 2006). In fact, preschool children’s vocabulary skills consistently predict later achievement in reading comprehension (Hindman, Skibbe, Miller, & Zimmerman, 2010, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network, 2005, Storch & Whitehurst, 2002), and early delays in vocabulary development have"

Of concern to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are those young children reared in poverty, given their well-documented early lags in vocabulary development (Hart & Risley, 1995) that typically persist as they progress from elementary to high school (Puma et al., 1997)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"Not surprisingly, considerable attention has focused on ways to facilitate the early vocabulary development of preschool children from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds in order to mitigate the well-documented achievement gap in the area of vocabulary (e.g., Neuman & Celano, 2001, Tabors, 1997, Wasik et al., 2006, Weizman & Snow, 2001, Wells, 1986). For instance, recent research has focused on the role that young children’s peers may play in facil- itating vocabulary development (e.g., Henry & Rickman, 2007, Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009). These investigations of peer effects within preschool classrooms show that the language skills of children’s classmates are a significant and unique predictor of language growth, even beyond effects attributable to instructional quality (Mashburn et al., 2009). Specifi- cally, higher peer language skills were positively related to children’s language outcomes during prekindergarten, indicating that children may benefit from being in a classroom that, in the aggregate, contains older, more cognitively advanced children and that this is particularly true for children with lower language skills. Such findings suggest that classroom age composition may be an important consideration in understanding factors that influence children’s vocabulary development within early education settings, as it provides information about peer characteristics in the classroom. For instance, if children’s vocabulary growth is facilitated through their interactions with peers, it may be important for younger children (e.g., 3-year-olds) to have opportunities to interact with older preschoolers, as would occur in mixed-age classrooms that serve 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"Presently, there is a great deal of variability in the age composition of preschool classrooms within the United States. Some classrooms, referred to as  same-age classrooms,  enroll only chil- dren within a particular age range, these typically enroll only 3-year-olds or only 4-year-olds. Other classrooms, characterized as mixed-age classrooms, have children whose ages may span several years (Goodlad & Anderson, 1987, McClellan, 1994) and may serve in one setting chil- dren as young as 3 years and as old as 5 or 6 years (e.g., Winsler et al., 2002). Although the way in which children are grouped within classrooms is highly variable, it is unclear whether class- room age composition has impacts on children’s growth, particularly in the area of vocabulary development. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the extent to which classroom age composition, operationalized based on variation in children’s chronological age, is associated with children’s vocabulary development over an academic year. In addressing this aim, we examined the vocabulary gains of 130 children enrolled in 16 preschool classrooms, which represented a subset of all children enrolled in these classrooms. Given that we did not have information on the ages of all children within the enrolled classrooms, the study represents an exploratory examination of the way in which classroom age composition may influence children’s language growth."

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"cultural (Vygotsky, 1930 = 1978) theories of learning and development. From these perspectives, interacting with older, more competent peers seems developmentally beneficial to children because it affords younger children the opportunity to engage in more challenging tasks and therefore experience greater cognitive growth than children without such opportunities. At the same time, it affords older children in such settings the opportunity to scaffold younger children, which may also provide benefits. For instance, younger children can enrich their learning by observing, emulating, and imitating the behaviors of older children (Bandura, 1986), whereas older children can practice prosocial behaviors (Derscheid, 1997, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986) and leadership skills as they serve as mentors for young children by providing support and guid- ance (Wertsch, 1985). In short, mixed-age classrooms provide children with the opportunity to form relations with a wider variety of children compared with their counterparts in same-age classrooms. Whaley and Kantor (1992) explicitly discussed the positive advantages of mixed infant = toddler classrooms, arguing that such classrooms provide children with a ‘‘family’’ and collaborative atmosphere. These researchers also suggested that mixed-age classrooms might help to minimize competitive pressure in terms of academic development by making parents more focused on their children’s individual development, which thereby decreases the competition among peers in the classroom."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"There are some arguments opposed to mixed-age classrooms that favor restricting the range of ages within preschool classrooms. For instance, in a recent study examining children’s learn- ing within mixed- and same-age classrooms, Moller, Forbes-Jones, and Hightower (2008) asserted that same-age classrooms allow teachers to target a specific age group in their curricu- lum, which allows them to focus on what is developmentally appropriate for that age group and thus may lead to better classroom quality. These researchers showed that preschoolers who are closer in age more closely resemble one another in terms of their skill and knowledge develop- ment. In addition, contrary to Whaley and Kantor’s (1992) assertion that older children nurture younger children in mixed-age classrooms, Goldman and Chaille´ (1984) found no evidence that older children engage in more nurturance or mentoring in mixed-age (3- to 5-year-old) groups compared to same-age groups. In general, it is somewhat unclear as to whether preschool-age children benefit from being in mixed- versus same-age classrooms and, if there is an advantage to either, whether this advantage extends to both older and younger children within the setting."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"Although there is a lack of congruence in findings among the available research on the effects of classroom age composition on child learning, researchers have considered how classroom age composition may be associated with preschoolers’ language skills indirectly by examining chil- dren’s communicative interactions with peers in mixed- and same-age programs. For example, the following year when the preschool adopted a mixed-age classroom model (3- to 4-year-olds). The researchers found that in the same-age classrooms, 4-year-olds tended to spend more time interacting with other children (as opposed to spending time alone) when given the choice compared to 3-year-olds, however, age differences in peer interaction were not found in the"

Winsler et al. also found that over the span of 22 weeks, children in the mixed-age preschool classrooms significantly decreased the amount of time they spent interact- ing with peers of a different age. The results of this study would seem to suggest that children may prefer to interact with their same-age peers even when placed in mixed-age classrooms. based child care programs and found that the longer 4-year-olds spent in a mixed-age child care program, the more frequently they spoke to a 2-year-old peer with whom they were matched in social development, which in turn increases the talk between older and younger children. One limitation of this study, however, is that this was a forced pairing rather than a naturalistic obser- vation of classroom dynamics. It is interesting to note that the available research presents con- flicted findings regarding the experiences of children in mixed- and same-age classroom settings, moreover, it is difficult to extrapolate from such work how classroom age composition might influence children’s language development over time. It is possible, for instance, to speculate based on the Winsler et al. (2002) findings that variation in classroom age composition (i.e., being in a mixed- vs. same-age classroom) would have little impact on children’s language growth if, in either setting, children tend to interact with same-age peers."
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,1,"A multilevel modeling approach was used to investigate the influence of age composition in 70 urban preschool classrooms. A series of hierarchical linear models demonstrated that greater variance in classroom age composition was negatively related to development on the Child Observation Record (COR) Cognitive, Motor, and Social subscales. This was true when controlling for class size, general classroom quality, and socioeconomic status at the classroom level and for age, gender, and baseline ability at the child level. Additionally, to address possible concerns related to nonrandom assignment to classrooms, a series of models were run including variance in developmental age (i.e., baseline ability) at the classroom level and at the child level. The results were consistent for chronological age composition and developmental age composition at the classroom level, greater variance in classroom developmental age composition was negatively related to Time 2 scores on the COR Cognitive, Motor, and Social subscales. Furthermore, a cross-level interaction indicated that negative influence of greater variance in classroom developmental age composition was stronger for children older in developmental age. Implications for early childhood education policy are discussed."
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,1,"There is a great deal of variability in the age composition of U.S. preschool classrooms. Some preschool programs tightly restrict the range of ages in their classrooms (e.g., 3-year-olds only). Other programs permit, and in some cases even promote, a wide range of ages in the same classroom (e.g., from 2.5 years to as old as 5 years). Such variability in practice follows from a lack of consen- sus in both the theoretical and the empirical literature on the effects of age composition of classrooms on individual learning. Research on the effects of classroom age composition on indi- vidual growth is not new. The theoretical writings of two pioneers in the field of early childhood development, Vygotsky and Piaget, are at odds with respect to the predicted impact of exposure of individual children to peers of variant ages on cognitive and social development (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliams, 1993, Hartup, 1993, Piaget, 1932, Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker 1998, Vygotsky,"
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,1,"1930/1978). From one perspective, that of Piaget (1932) and others, interacting with peers who are close in age is preferable. Children close in age are also likely to be more closely matched in terms of knowledge, skill, and power. As a result, children in such a setting are able to engage in and resolve cognitive and social conflicts with each other and play a variety of roles in their resolution. By contrast, Vygotsky and others argued that interac- tion with older, more competent children provides an optimal context for cognitive and behavioral development (Vygotsky, 1930/1978). Interestingly, in the years since, relatively little empirical con- sensus has emerged. Yet despite a lack of consensus, the National Association for the Education of Young Children has given mixed- age classrooms its endorsement 1   (Bredekamp, 1987), in line with several researchers in the field (e.g., Katz, Evangelou, & Hartman, 1990, Whaley & Kantor, 1992). We now explore the extant liter- ature relating to preschool classroom age composition more closely."
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,1,"Proponents of mixed-age preschool classrooms typically focus on the age-specific benefits most relevant to the younger children in such groupings.

Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"younger children benefit from being exposed to and modeling the behavior of older children (Bandura, 1986). In support, Rothstein- Fisch and Howes (1988) found that when toddlers interacted with slightly older peers, the younger children exhibited more complex language and engaged in more complex play in a family childcare setting. Howes and Farver (1987) similarly found that toddlers whose play partners were older peers engaged in more complex social play. Other advocates for mixed-age classrooms have posited that older children, too, may benefit from exposure to younger children (Katz et al., 1990, Lloyd, 1999). For example, in such settings older children are in a position to more readily practice prosocial behavior (Derscheid, 1997, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986) and leader- ship skills (French, Waas, Stright, & Baker, 1986), given their elevated status in mixed-age group interactions. Chapman (1994) found that older children in a mixed-age elementary school setting served as mentors for younger children both spontaneously and when asked. Although the specific benefits that have been linked to mixed-age peer interaction have thus far been age specific (i.e., only relevant to younger or older children), advocates of mixed- age classrooms maintain that the age-specific advantages are pre- sumably passed on as a child progresses through such a program (i.e., younger children will one day be older children in the same classroom), and thus an egalitarian ethic is preserved. Further research has suggested additional benefits of mixed-age classrooms for all children, regardless of age. For example, re- search by Goldman (1981) has suggested that both 3- and 4-year- olds in mixed-age preschool classrooms engaged in significantly less parallel (as opposed to interactive) forms of play, relative to those in same-age classrooms. An investigation by Urberg and Kaplan (1986) found that both older and younger children in mixed-age preschool classrooms exhibited greater interactive functional play and less parallel functional play, relative to those in same-age classrooms. Rubin, Maioni, and Hornung (1976) have argued that interactive play represents a more mature level of play, classrooms facilitate more mature play and therefore more optimal social–cognitive development. Whaley and Kantor (1992) suggested that mixed-age classrooms may help to lessen the likelihood of parents and caregivers to make comparisons among children in terms of development. Instead, mixed-age rooms allow parents to focus on each child’s develop- ment as an individual. As such, mixed-age classrooms may de- crease competition between peers, focusing children instead on more mastery-oriented goals. Many studies conducted with chil- dren, adolescents, and college students confirm that focusing on individual standards (i.e., mastery goals) is optimal in terms of maintaining both intrinsic motivation and achievement in the classroom (see Elliot & Dweck, 2005, and Nicholls, 1989, for reviews). Blasco, Bailey, and Burchinal (1993) found that children with developmental disabilities, in particular, were more likely to engage in mastery play when they were enrolled in mixed-age settings. Whaley and Kantor (1992) further speculated that benefits ex- tend to both children and teachers as a result of the “family climate” and continuity of care fostered by mixed-age classrooms. climate encountered when moving between restricted-age class- rooms at larger childcare facilities could be stressful for both the"

However, an empirical investigation into the perceived stress levels of children and teachers in such facil- ities has yet to be published. alent in mixed-age classrooms relative to restricted-age settings (Field, 1982, Lougee, Grueneich, & Hartup, 1977, Roopnarine et al., 1992, Roopnarine & Johnson, 1984). It seems that in mixed- age contexts, age plays a more powerful role than gender in peer playmate selection. Thus, at a society level, long-term promotion of gender equality might be better served by more preschools moving toward a greater diversity in terms of classroom age composition. Such an argument is highly speculative, as no em- pirical explorations into a relation between preschool classroom age composition and attitudes related to gender equality have been conducted. Finally, some research has supported the notion that mixed-age peer interactions occur naturally, outside the classroom context (Ellis, Rogoff, & Cromer, 1981). An observational study by Ellis et al. (1981) of 436 children ages 1–2 found that target children were with same-age peers in only 6% of the observations recorded, compared with 55% of the observations involving mixed-age peer interactions (with children who differed in age by at least 1 year). These findings related to naturalistic social interactions, however, are inconclusive to the extent that this may be because of peer accessibility or children actively seeking out companionship from mixed-age peers. Goldman’s (1981) research on mixed- versus same-age preschool classrooms demonstrated that—within mixed- age classrooms—age did not significantly influence choice of naturally better suited to developing in the context of mixed-age groups (Ellis et al., 1981, Whaley & Kantor, 1992)."
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"The central argument in favor of restricting the range of age in preschool classrooms concerns a desire to provide each child with an optimal degree of challenge and the utility of specialization toward meeting this goal. As such, a criticism that has been levied against mixed-age classrooms in favor of more restricted-age pre- school groupings concerns the development of age-appropriate curriculum and staff training. Specifically, when teacher training and curriculum are uniquely focused on what is developmentally appropriate for a more restricted age range of children, the quality of the classroom climate will be higher. rooms facilitate more mature forms of play (Goldman, 1981, Howes & Farver, 1987, Rothstein-Fisch & Howes, 1998, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986), other researchers have found evidence to the contrary or suggestive of a more complex effect than is often highlighted. For example, Roopnarine et al. (1992) observed more social and nonsocial dramatic play in preschoolers attending same- age relative to mixed-age classrooms, whereas more social– constructive and nonsocial manipulative play was seen in mixed- age classrooms. Roopnarine et al. maintained that dramatic play was the more complex form of play relative to manipulative play, suggesting that same-age classrooms facilitated more sophisticated play behaviors. Urberg and Kaplan (1986) reported finding a greater incidence of interactive, mature forms of play in mixed-age preschool classrooms relative to same-age classrooms, however,"
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"mixed-age classrooms. For instance, younger children in mixed- age classrooms tended to be involved in a greater number of negative interactions. This was attributed to the potential for frus- tration in older children resulting from interactions with less ma- ture younger children. Furthermore, Urberg and Kaplan found that older children in mixed-age classrooms were more likely to be onlookers, detaching themselves from social interaction. Similarly, Goldman (1981) found more solitary play and less participation in teacher-directed activities among older children in mixed-age classrooms. Urberg and Kaplan speculated that teachers in the mixed-age classrooms might have had a more difficult time pro- viding a sufficient variety of activities suitable for keeping chil- dren of varied age and ability interested and involved. Proponents of mixed-age classrooms often focus on benefits to younger children, but the potential costs to the older children in such classrooms may sometimes be overlooked. A study of mixed- age elementary school classrooms (children ages 6 to 9 years) by Byrnes, Shuster, and Jones (1994) confirmed that both older stu- dents and their parents rated the quality of the academics in multiage classrooms less positively than that in single-age class- rooms. Despite failing to report any benefits found for older, more ought to pay special attention to helping “more able students in seeing how they benefit from being in multiage classrooms” (p. 21). In another observational investigation of play behavior in different classrooms, Dunn, Kontos, and Potter (1996) monitored family childcare homes and found that frequency of interactions with older peers were associated with more complex cognitive play, whereas interactions with younger and same-age peers were associated with less complex social and cognitive play and lower receptive language scores. One lab experiment (Tudge, 1992) compared mixed- versus matched-competence peers (ages 5–9 years) working in dyads. The results of this experiment suggested that regression in thinking was as likely a consequence of mixed groupings as was improvement. These results suggest that at least with regard to some cognitive outcomes, older children in mixed- age groups may suffer. Furthermore, support for such a hypothesis was found by Winsler et al. (2002). Winsler et al. studied longi- tudinally one preschool’s transition from two single-age class- rooms (separate 3- and 4-year-olds) to two mixed-age classrooms (combined 3- and 4-year-olds). In this study, statistical interactions were found between child age and classroom age composition in predicting task focus in the classroom. Although 3-year-olds seemed to do better after the change to mixed-age classrooms, 4-year-olds were observed to be less focused and goal directed. Moreover, children of both ages were observed demonstrating significantly more overt positive affect (e.g., smiles and laughter) and less neutral affect in the single-age classrooms compared with the mixed-aged classrooms. The 1995 meta-analysis conducted by Veenman concluded that there were no academic or social differences between elementary school children attending mixed-age and same-age classrooms. Similarly, Blasco et al. (1993) reported no differences in terms of complex mastery play in same- versus mixed-age classrooms when their observations focused on typically developing preschool-age children, the benefits attributed to mixed-age classrooms and re- ported above were (again) specific to children with developmental disabilities."
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"As noted, many of the theoretical assertions for or against mixed- and restricted-age groupings are based on the assumption that age is closely related to ability. By this token, ability-based groupings may be expected to have an influence on developmental outcomes similar to that of age-based groupings. Mirroring the literature supporting the efficacy of mixed-age classrooms, many researchers have championed mixed-ability groupings in terms of benefits to be reaped by disadvantaged children who are lower in ability (Guralnick, 1981, Rogers & Ross, 1986, Tach & Fargas, 2006). For example, Tach and Fargas (2006) found that within kin- dergarten and first-grade classrooms in which ability-based groupings were used, placement into a higher ability group exerted a uni- formly positive effect on student learning-related behavior and reading achievement. Typically, these studies have implicitly as- sumed that the costs for higher ability children in such mixed- ability groupings are negligible, although several exceptions (e.g., Guralnick, 1981) have reported no detrimental impact on higher ability children in mixed-ability groupings. Nevertheless, a theme that runs through these studies advocating for mixed-ability group- ings is that an important and focal goal is ensuring that the needs of students who have experienced situations that place them at risk or are disadvantageous for their academic development are met. From an entirely different perspective, some researchers have advocated expressly for the interests of the most gifted and tal- ented children. Researchers focused on those children higher in ability tend to advocate for more restricted-ability groupings, such that high-ability children have more opportunities to interact with peers of similar ability (e.g., Gallagher, 1986). To summarize, as is the case in the literature focused on age-related groupings, the literature on ability-related groupings is mixed, furthermore, the most controversial aspect of the debate concerns those children in mixed contexts who are older, higher in ability, or both."
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Many of the studies that have expressly focused on classroom age composition have targeted an elementary school population, which makes it difficult to extend the conclusions to preschool classrooms (e.g., Chapman, 1994, French et al., 1986, Veenman, 1995). Early childhood (ages 2 to 5) is a period of relatively rapid development, thus, the impact of age differences in classroom composition within this range is likely to be magnified, if not distinctly different, in preschool classrooms relative to that found in elementary school settings among older children. Furthermore, as Winsler et al. (2002, p. 306) pointed out, “most of the (extant) research exploring the effects of age-composition on children’s peer interactions has been conducted in laboratory or quasi-laboratory settings.” In other words, with few exceptions, the extant literature lacks empirical research on preschool classroom age composition conducted in preschool classrooms. The excep- tions (Bailey et al., 1993, Goldman, 1981, Winsler et al., 2002) have been limited to research conducted with a relatively small number of classrooms, typically restricted to a single organization. For example, Bailey et al.’s (1993) investigation tracked the de- velopmental trajectories of just 59 children between the ages of 21 and 67 months. Goldman’s (1981) sample consisted of just three"
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"classrooms, and Winsler et al.’s (2002) sample included only four. Furthermore, the samples included in the vast majority of studies reviewed above came from affluent or middle-class suburban communities. From the perspective of triage at the level of public policy, an argument could be made for focusing attention first on the neediest and most underserved populations. Yet, urban samples of lower socioeconomic standing have typically been ignored in this literature. An additional limitation of the extant literature is that researchers have typically focused on a limited range of outcomes, perhaps masking a richer, more ambiguous phenomenon. We undertook an investigation into the question of preschool classroom age composition on a scale far larger than previously conducted (806 children in 70 classrooms), a sample that included every preschool classroom under the administrative umbrella of a public school district in a mid-sized city (approximate popula- tion    212,000). We included as outcomes in our research well- validated measures of various aspects of development (cognitive, social, and motor) and controlled for baseline levels on entering the classroom. Furthermore, we assessed and controlled for gen- eral classroom quality. As a result, this research should offer fresh and rich insight into questions concerning the consequences of preschool classroom age composition that can be extended more easily to urban populations."

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,2,"The zone of proximal development concept is widely accepted and has had considerable influence on early childhood education programs. For example, the zone is commonly used as a rationale for the establishment of literacy-enriched play centers. Traditional dramatic play areas, such as housekeeping and restaurant centers, are stocked with theme-related lit- eracy materials. For example, a restaurant center might be equipped with menus, wall signs, pencils, and notepads (for taking food orders). Research- ers assert that two aspects of these settings encourage children to incorpo- rate familiar literacy routines and activities into their play: (a) the literacy artifacts or tools that are placed into the play center, and (b) opportunities for children to interact with adults and more capable peers in connection with these materials (Christie, 1994, Morrow & Rand, 1991, Neuman & Roskos, 1997, Vukelich, 1993).

Multi-age classrooms present a context for learning that differs markedly from teacher-centered instruction that was the norm in the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 1930s, when Vygotsky developed the concept of the zone. Bruner (1987) has pointed out that ""Vygotsky was one of the great theory makers of the first half of this century - along with Freud, McDougall, Piaget, and a very few others. Like them, his ideas are situated in his times. But like the best of them, those ideas still point to the future of our discipline."" (p. 16)"

But some researchers, who have observed children in classrooms that encourage collaborative learning among peers, suggest a more complex model of the zone. For example, Goodman and Goodman (1990) have argued that ""all social interactions, not only those involving expert peers and adults, provide opportunities for children to learn more about the world"" (p. 228)."

In the first year, the classroom was organized as a multi-age classroom with a mix of kindergartners, first graders, and second graders. The second year, the classroom was a traditional same-age kindergarten with 5-year-old stu- dents.  The teacher, room arrangement, and materials in the play center all remained the same.

Supporters of multi-age grouping, citing the zone, claim that the broader the age of children in a classroom, the greater the opportunity for collaborative learn- ing. However, there is scant evidence to back up this claim. If the multi- age advocates are correct, we should find a larger amount, and perhaps a broader range, of collaborative literacy interactions occurring in multi- age class than in the same-age kindergarten.  Our second purpose was to examine the directionality of collaborative literacy exchanges.  The zone concept assumes that collaboration is unidirectional, with older or more competent children always helping younger or less competent peers. We wanted to learn if collaborative exchanges are actually this simple, or if other more complex patterns of interaction would emerge when these ex- changes are closely examined."

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",3,"Abstract: Theorists and researchers have conflicting opinions and findings regarding the role of mixed-age classrooms in  preschool education. According to Piaget interactions with peers of the same age are preferable, since children closer in  age are more likely to learn in similar ways. However, Vygotsky believed that interactions among children of different  ages provide an optimal context for development. The present study aimed at assessing whether mixed or same-age  classroom status affects the quality of peer interactions, teacher-child interactions, and children’s behaviors in the  preschool classroom. Data from 308 teachers placed in three, four, and mixed three- and four-year-old classrooms,  serving children from low socio-economic status in urban preschools, was analyzed using General Linear Models  (GLM). The results have shown that in mixed-age classrooms, teachers reported lower levels of conflicts in peer  interactions (F (1, 302) = 9.92, p = .0001), lower levels of negative teacher-child interactions (F (1, 302) = 6.13, p =  .002), and marginally lower levels of challenging behaviors than in same-age classrooms (F (1,302) = 3.41, p = .06).  The results of this study inform theory and practice regarding the role of mixed-age classrooms in preschool education  and can prove valuable in the development and implementation of preschool programs, especially those serving low- income children."

According to Piaget (1932), interactions with  peers of the same-age are preferable, since same-age children are more likely to have  similar problem-solving skills and construct knowledge in similar ways. However, Vygotsky  (1978) believed that interactions among children of different ages provide an optimal context for  development, as both older and younger children benefit from the process of “scaffolding.”  Research has resulted in mixed findings, with several studies supporting the benefits of mixed- age classrooms (Rothstein-Fisher and Howes 1988), and several studies supporting the benefits  of same-age classrooms in preschool education (Moller, Forbes-Jones, and Hightower 2008)."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",3,"The Montessori’s (1912) approach to early childhood curriculum strongly supports mixed- age classrooms in preschool, claiming it helps children learn to regulate emotions and develop  social skills. Similarly, the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC),  the United States’ foremost professional organization for early childhood educators, has followed  the Vygotsky and Montessori approach and endorsed the implementation of mixed-age early  childhood classrooms throughout the United States (NAEYC 1996). Despite the lack of  consensus in the field and the relatively little research available in the area, mixed-age  classrooms are fairly common in preschool programs across the United States, especially those  serving low-income children, such as Head Start. The present study was aimed at addressing the  gap in the literature by assessing whether mixed or same-age groups affected social processes in  the preschool classroom including peer interactions, teacher-child interactions, and challenging  behaviors."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Vygotsky (1978) proposed that children in mixed-aged groups gain social skills during the  process of “scaffolding,” in which a more competent individual supports the learning process of a  less competent one, through social interactions and modeling. Through scaffolding, older  children have the opportunity to develop confidence and leadership skills, while younger children  learn social and language skills from more competent peers. Researchers have found support for  Vygotsky’s ideas. For example, Rothstein-Fisher and Howes (1988) found that younger children  in mixed-age classrooms displayed more complex language use because of their interactions with  older children, as compared to children in same-age classrooms. Similarly, they found that  younger children displayed more complex social and dramatic play skills as a result of their  interactions with older children. Studies have also found several advantages for older children in  mixed-age classrooms. For example, Hercheid (1997) found that interacting with younger  French et al. (1986) found that older children in mixed-age classrooms display more leadership  skills. Lastly, research has found that in mixed-age classrooms, older children had the  opportunity to develop mentorship skills (Moller et al. 2008)."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Researchers have also identified simultaneous benefits for younger and older children. For  example, Goldman (1981) observed that in mixed-age classrooms younger and older children  engaged in less parallel play and in more interactive play (Goldman 1981). Similarly, in mixed- age classrooms, parents and teachers made less comparisons based on age and focused more on  children as individuals (Whale and Kantor 1992). This resulted in a decrease in competition  among peers and a focus on mastery-oriented goals. Mixed-age classrooms were found to be  especially beneficial for children with disabilities, who benefit from the decrease in comparison  and competition and the focus on individual goals that is natural in mixed-age classrooms  (Blasco et al. 1993)."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Nevertheless, Piaget (1932) believed that children are more likely to construct knowledge and  problem-solve when they can exchange ideas with peers with similar skills and abilities.  According to Piaget, because of older children’s modeling and younger children’s imitation,  younger children might miss out on the opportunity to create their own knowledge. In addition,  older children might lack challenging opportunities to test their problem-solving skills. In  contrast, in same-age groups peers with similar levels of social power would be able to gain  social skills by learning to negotiate and resolve disputes as equals."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Some researchers have found support for Piaget’s ideas. For example, the mixed-age  classroom had been found to present low academic challenges for older children (Dunn, Kontos,  and Potter 1996), and children displayed lower scores in social, motor, and cognitive  development with greater age variability in their class (Moller et al. 2008). In addition,  researchers found that children engaged in more complex forms of play in same-age classrooms  (Roopnarine 1992). They also found that children engaged in less solitary play and participated  more in teacher-directed activities in same-age classrooms (Goldman 1981). Furthermore, studies  found that in mixed-age classrooms, younger children were involved in more negative  interactions (Urberg and Kaplan 1986), and older children were more detached and displayed  onlooker behaviors more often (Goldman 1981). In sum, the research findings are not conclusive  when it comes to comparing the effects of mixed and same-age classrooms on young children."

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,"Social processes, such as peer interactions and teacher-child interactions, represent a cornerstone  of early childhood education. Promoting an environment that supports these processes is  considered to be a priority to preschool educators. Classroom age composition might play an  important role in the way children interact with each other, in the way teachers interact with  children, and correspondingly, in the behavioral outcomes of children in the classroom. Positive  peer interactions play a key developmental role in preschool, and they predict a positive  perception of school, better adjustment to kindergarten, and positive academic outcomes in  elementary and high school. On the other hand, poor interactions with peers in preschool are  associated with lower academic performance and emotional maladjustment (McWayne,  Fantuzzo, and McDermott 2004). In addition, peer interactions are especially important for  children in low-income urban areas who experience several challenges, and these interactions  have been shown to be a protective factor by helping children become resilient in the face of  cumulative adversity (Hampton and Fantuzzo 2003)."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,"Similar to peer-interactions, teacher-child interactions are particularly important in the  preschool classroom (Dobbs and Arnold, 2009). The preschool teacher is generally the first  adult-child interaction outside of the family. Positive teacher-child relationships help children  develop social skills to negotiate challenging situations and help children have a more positive  perception of school (Moritz Rudasill and Rimm-Kaufman 2009). Positive teacher-child  interactions in preschool have a positive influence on children’s language, academic  performance, and social competence in elementary school (McWayne et al. 2004). A child’s  ability to respond to social demands with appropriate behavior is a skill developed during the  preschool years. By the end of the fifth year of life, the level of a child’s ability to control and  moderate his or her behavior in response to social situations remains stable for the rest of his or  her development (Raikes et al. 2007). On the other hand, challenging behaviors are some of the  biggest concerns of preschool teachers, as behavior plays a central role in children’s ability to  transition and adjust to school and succeed academically. Furthermore, most teachers consider  behavior a bigger challenge in early education than a lack of academic skill. For example, Rimm- Kaufman, Pianta, and Cox (2000) found in a national representative group of kindergarten  teachers in the United States, most teachers considered problem behaviors a bigger challenge in  children’s adjustment to kindergarten than academic competency. This finding points to the  importance of looking at the preschool years as a key developmental stage to preventing  challenging behaviors."

Similarly, because of the importance of addressing and preventing  levels of problem behaviors, can be considered highly informative."

Furthermore, in most studies, children’s  challenging behaviors and quality teacher-child interactions were not taken into account, despite  the central role of these processes in the preschool classroom. In addition, most studies were  restricted in the number of classrooms and were conducted in one organization. Very few studies  focused on programs targeting low socio-economic status (SES) children (Moller et al. 2008).

The purpose of the current investigation is to address these competing hypotheses by examining the academic implications of having di ff erent-age peers across two school years and the role of tea- cher continuity in evaluating the bene fi ts and drawbacks of mixed-age classrooms in Head Start. This type of longitudinal empirical inquiry is of growing importance given the fact that some scholars and profes- sional and national associations have been promoting mixed-age groupings as bene fi cial for children in early childhood programs even when there has been little evidence either in support of (or against) this type of educational programming ( Katz et al., 1990 )."
Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,1,Our interest in understanding the unique in fl uence of classroom age
Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,2,"composition across school years is grounded in several long-standing educational and developmental models. The overarching framework for our work is based on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory, which emphasizes the importance of contextual in fl uences on children's early learning and development ( Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006 ). In line with this theory, the current investigation considers how speci fi c proximal processes within Head Start classrooms — age composition and teacher continuity — can in fl uence children's academic achievement. Bandura's (1986)  social learning theory and  Vygotsky's (1978)  theory of cognitive development also shape our developmental framework for this study as they both contend that one of the primary mechanisms through which development occurs in early childhood programs is through interactions between children and their classmates. Younger children can observe older and more skilled children in the classroom and mimic their behaviors and actions and older children can sca ff old younger children who, in turn, can cement their own skills and knowledge. When taken together, these transactional processes among peers can constitute one of the key mechanisms through which early childhood programs impact children's academic and social-behavioral development (e.g.,  Henry & Rickman, 2007 ,  Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014 ,  Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009 ,  Ribeiro, Zachrisson, & Dearing, 2017 )."
Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,2,"Despite its plausible theoretical underpinnings and endorsements by national organizations, the evidence behind these types of classrooms has been largely inconclusive when looking at children's early academic and socioemotional development, with some early childhood scholars documenting positive impacts ( Blasco, Bailey, & Burchinal, 1993 , Goldman, 1981 ,  Guo, Tompkins, Justice, & Petscher, 2014 ,  Justice, negative associations ( Ansari et al., 2016 ,  Bell, Green fi eld, & Bulotsky- Shearer, 2013 ,  Moller, Forbes-Jones, & Hightower, 2008 ,  Urberg & Kaplan, 1986 ,  Winsler et al., 2002 ). Studies of the academic bene fi ts of mixed-age (or multi-grade) classrooms serving children in the ele- mentary grades has also been largely ambiguous, with some studies documenting academic e ff ects that were positive, negative, and statis- tically indistinguishable ( Ansari, 2017 ,  Pratt, 1986 ,  Proehl, Douglas, Elias, Johnson, & Westsmith, 2013 ,  Thomas, 2012 ,  Veenman, 1995 , Way, 1981 ). Thus, across the educational spectrum, the empirical support for mixed-age education has been largely inconclusive."
Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,2,"Even with the con fl icting empirical evidence in the existing litera- ture, a study by  Ansari et al. (2016)  is of note as it represents the  fi rst national study of mixed-age classrooms in the United States for  fi rst time Head Start attendees. More speci fi cally,  Ansari et al. (2016) documented sizeable negative associations between mixed-age class- rooms for newly enrolled 4-year-olds' math and language and literacy learning, and found that classroom age composition did not  have mean- level associations with the early academic success of 3-year-olds. Practically speaking, the drawbacks of mixed-age classrooms for  fi rst- time 4-year-old Head Start attendees amounted to approximately four to  fi ve months of academic development when they attended class- rooms that enrolled an equal number of 3- and 4-year-olds. There were, however, no bene fi ts or drawbacks of mixed-age classrooms for chil- dren's socioemotional development ( Ansari et al., 2016 )."
Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,2,"To date, however, no studies, including Ansari et al. (2016) , have examined what happens to the 3-year-olds in their second year of Head Start. That is, what happens to children who spend two years in mixed- age classrooms? This type of empirical analysis has important im- plications for policy and practice as the majority of children who attend Head Start at age 3 remain in the program for a second year as 4-year- olds ( Puma et al., 2010 ). In fact, this empirical inquiry into mixed-age education can point to one of the potential reasons why children who experience preschool — especially Head Start — at ages 3 and 4 make greater gains during their  fi rst year than in their second ( Jenkins, Farkas, Duncan, Burchinal, & Vandell, 2016 ,  Yoshikawa et al., 2013 ). Accordingly, our  fi rst research objective was to assess the academic implications of mixed-age classrooms for 3-year-olds during their"

(2016) , we expected that children who were enrolled in class- rooms with a greater share of younger classmates during their second year in Head Start as 4-year-olds would demonstrate smaller gains in areas of literacy and math."
Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,2,"As part of the current investigation, we also consider the implica- tions of mixed-age education for children's academic achievement when they experience continuity and/or changes in classroom age composi- tion across two years in the Head Start program. In other words, what happens to children in the program who transition from classrooms where their classmates are largely the same age during year one to classrooms where there are largely di ff erent age peers in year two? Alternatively, what happens to children who are enrolled in classrooms with largely di ff erent age peers across both school years? Taking a multi-year perspective on children's classroom experiences is grounded in developmental theory ( Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006 ) and can allow for a more nuanced understanding of the di ff erent ways in which classroom dynamics shape children's academic success."
Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,2,"Perhaps mixed-age classrooms require children to be present for multiple years to reap the maximum bene fi t ( Lillard, 2016 ). For ex- ample, being a younger child in a classroom in one year — although not bene fi ting them immediately ( Ansari et al., 2016 ) — may motivate children to be like one of their older classmates ( Winsler et al., 2002 ) and, thus, in their second year, these children may start school with skills that allow them to more effectively sca ff old for their younger peers and cement their own skills and knowledge. On the other hand, a recent report from the Department of Education clearly shows that the vast majority of educators feel underprepared to individualize and di ff erentiate their instruction ( Manship, Farber, Smith, & Drummond, 2016 ), and therefore, it is also conceivable that regardless of children's prior experiences in mixed-age settings, these types of environments are not optimal for their early learning. Regardless of the outcome, this type of longitudinal empirical inquiry is of utmost importance because these transitions across years likely represent qualitatively di ff erent experiences that might alter the meaning of mixed-age education for children in any given year. Examining 3-year-olds in the Head Start program in particular presents a unique opportunity to assess the im- plications of such transitions and we address this objective concerning children's classroom transitions in two di ff erent ways."

This study examines the relations between  classroom age variability on children’s vocabulary development for 2,743 children between the  ages of two years, nine months, and six years, 11 months enrolled in early childhood education  settings in Denmark. Findings indicate a significant nonlinear relationship between the range of  child age within a classroom and children’s vocabulary development, such that classrooms with a  maximum age range of 24 months were associated with the greatest gains in vocabulary growth.

Does mixing age groups in early childhood.pdf,2,"Of relevance to the research reported here, when  ECE programs are created and expanded, there are  certain structural features  of such programs that can  be directly affected by the policies that create them.  These features include, for instance, teacher-child ratio,  class size, and teacher credentials. For example,  state-sponsored support of ECE programs might  stipulate a 1:9 teacher-child ratio with a maximum class  size of 18 children, and provision of programming by  teachers with at least a bachelor’s degree. An additional  structural feature often affected by policies is the age  composition of ECE classrooms, as creation/expansion  policies often stipulate the age range of children who  can participate in subsidized programming. For  instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia’s long-running  Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) provides funding  for more than 10,000 4-year-olds across the state to  participate in center-based ECE each year (Huang,  Invernizzi, & Drake,  2012 ).

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"Because of severe economic cuts in the child care budget in Sweden from 1990 to 1993, a sharp increase in the number of children in child care classes has been observed (Lidholt & Norrman, 1994). Average class sizes have risen throughout the country, although there are great differences between, and even within, communities. In the early 1980s, it was rare to have more than 15 children in a class. In 1993, one third of classes had at least 18 children. Simultaneously with the increase in classes, the number of employees in child care centers decreased. During the 1980s, there were, on average, four children per full-time employee. In 1993, the number of children per full-time employee had increased to as much as six (Lidholt & Norrman, 1994). New laws have also had a significant impact on the Swedish child care system. Until 1991, profit-run child care centers could not, based on Swedish law, receive public funding. The average annual cost for one child in public agencies was about $10,000 US in 1993. The federal govern- cost, with parental fees financing the remaining 10%. This made it impractical to run private child care without public funding. However, after 1991, the local"

The sample included 394 3- to 5-year-old children from 32 child care centers. Results show that the profit child care centers had larger child groups than nonprofit child care centers, a lower adult:child ratio, and a positive staff attitude toward teaching goals. Age, gender, social background, and age span of the child care class were significant predictors of children’s social and cognitive achievements. Adult-to-child ratio and teaching style did not prove to be good predictors of children’s social or cognitive achievements."

Nonprofit private child care in Stockholm has doubled between 1991 and 1994, leaving 16% of all children attending child care in private nonprofit centers and 5% in profit child care. Thus, the transformations that occurred in the beginning of the 1990s within the Swedish child care system make a naturalistic experiment feasible. The main purpose of this study is to examine the potential effects of adult:child ratio and profit child care on teaching and children’s social and cognitive achievements."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"According to Kagan (1991), a nonprofit organization, such as public child care, is unlikely to exploit the consumer (the parents) because it cannot distribute profit to those who control the organization. Conversely, in a profit-oriented organiza- tion, such as profit child care, in which parents cannot directly evaluate the quality of the services the children actually receive and the children are not qualified to evaluate the services themselves, there are motivation and legal sanctions to promote increased profit. Accordingly, profit firms are more likely to cut costs and reduce quality. Based on this reasoning, nonprofit child care centers are likely to be superior in quality relative to profit child care centers. Research does not consistently verify this assumption, however (Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995, Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995). Although profit child care centers have been characterized by lower adult:child ratios, they generally have a better- trained staff (Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995). Group size and the quality of the environment (including quality of interactions between staff and children) are not clearly related to type of child care program (Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995, Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995). lay persons to influence child care quality and children’s development. Statisti- cally reliable relationships have been moderately positive in some studies (e.g., Clarke-Stewart, Gruber, & Fitzgerald, 1994, Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995, Holloway & Reichart-Erickson, 1988, Howes, Phillips, & Whitebook, 1992, Howes, Rodning, Galluzzo, & Myers, 1988), whereas others (e.g., Broberg, Hwang, Lamb, & Ketterlinus, 1989, Deater-Deckard, Pinkerton, & Scarr, 1996, Palme´rus & Ha¨gglund, 1987, Russel, 1990, Scarr, Eisenberg, & Deater-Deckard, 1994) have failed to support the notion of higher child care quality in cases with higher adult:child ratios. Such contradictory findings suggest the importance of other predictors of child care quality. For instance, a strong consensus among teachers and their aides involves the idea that educational goals and the means to accomplish these goals could compensate for a decreased adult:child ratio. This interpretation is consistent with the findings of Russel (1990) and Palme´rus and Ha¨gglund (1987). Variation in teacher education and experience are also likely relevant in explaining child care quality (Clarke-Stewart et al., 1994). Another possibility is that the relationship between child care quality and adult:child ratio is nonlinear. In this respect, differences in the adult:child ratio have a negligible effect beyond a certain ratio (e.g., 7 children or more per"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"adult), but at lower ratios (e.g., 4–6 children per adult) are more likely to affect children’s development. Because studies concerned with adult:child ratios have typically investigated the effects of differences between ratios of 1:7 or lower, clear, positive effects might not emerge until comparisons include both low and high ratios."

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,"Students ’  learning through interacting with each other rather than only with their teacher is of much interest to educational researchers and practitioners, it is also a highly evaluated goal (Webb,  1989 ). The social skills of individuals allow them to participate in learning activities in small groups and learn from each other (Huber & Huber,  2007 ). Vygotsky ( 1978 ) suggested that children ’ s knowledge and ideas develop through interactions with others. In his view social interactions with more capable peers play a key role in under- standing the meaning of concepts, and thus in learning. To achieve this, students need a learning environment that promotes interactive learning processes, preferably from the lower grades of education (Huber & Huber,  2007 ). At the heart of this view of learning is the situation or context within which learning takes place. Taking into consideration"
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"that learning is a transactive phenomenon existing in situations created by the teacher, and that social interactions and skills allow individuals to bene fi t from the opportunities to learn from each other, the teacher can create environments in which students can collab- orate with peers and adults (Hassard & Dias,  2009 ). Examples of such environments are small mixed-ability cooperative groups, the use of which is supported by extensive evi- dence from numerous studies (e.g. Blumenfeld, Marx, Soloway, & Krajcik,  1996 , Gillies, 2003 , Katz,  1995 , Nastasi & Clements,  1991 ). Students in small heterogeneous groups help, share and support each other ’ s learning as their members provide information, prompts, cues and encouragement in response to other children ’ s needs (Gillies,  2003 , Hassard & Dias,  2009 ). Often they are more aware of their peers ’  needs than their teachers, and can explain problems in a way that can be readily understood (Webb & Farivar,  1994 ). It has been found that children achieve more when they work together in small groups than they do in whole class, attain higher academic outcomes and are more motivated to achieve (Gillies,  2003 , Lou et al.,  1996 )."

Krajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, and Soloway ( 2000 ) mention that one of the aims of collaboration and interaction is to build knowledge through talks and discussion. This collaboration also introduces the stu- dents to the  ‘ language ’  of the discipline under study and to ways of knowledge acquisition."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"While small-group-learning has a long history (Wagner,  1982 ), it is only in the last decades that researchers have studied the interactions within them that facilitate learning and the factors that lead to different patterns of interaction (Webb,  1989 ). One of these factors is the number of participants in a small learning group. Lou et al. ( 1996 ) have found that children ’ s bene fi ts from small-group work are contingent on group size and composition. Huber and Huber ( 2007 ) suggest that groups should comprise as many members as are still able to interact directly with each other. Another factor that has proved to be important is the age of the members of a small group. Furman, Rahe, and Hartup ( 1979 ) maintain that socialization in mixed-age groups serves children in many ways that same-age socialization does not, and note that mixed-age groups require accom- modations between individuals whose developmental levels differ. It has been found that learning more usually takes place through the interactions of older children with younger ones."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"Katz ( 1995 ) notes that mixed-age grouping, especially in early childhood settings, is intended to increase the heterogeneity of the group so as to capitalize on the differences in knowledge, ability and experience of the children. The study suggests that in a mixed-age group younger children are capable of participating in and contributing to more complex activities than they could initiate if they were by themselves. Katz ( 1995 ) also reports that research on social bene fi ts indicates that children very early associate different expectations with different age groups: for example, younger children assign older ones instructional, leadership, helpful and sympathizing roles, whereas older"

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"The following  fi ndings are also of importance: (a) children prefer to be taught by chil- dren older than themselves (Allen & Feldman,  1976 ), (b) older children are more effective models than younger children (Peifer,  1971 ) and (c) reciprocal imitation is more charac- teristic of children ’ s interactions with older children than with younger children (Roberts, 1980 , Thelen & Kirkland,  1976 )."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"Modeling is the process by which younger children pick up behaviors they observe in older ones. If older students and younger students work closely while engaging in learning activities, the younger students will seek to imitate the behaviors modeled by the older ones (Merrick,  1996 ). Younger children will imitate both academic and social behaviors demonstrated by older children. Merrick ( 1996 ) maintains that nothing is more interest- ing to a child than another child who has the skills that he/she would like to acquire. In addition to this unintended natural modeling, older students can also provide direct instruction to younger ones. Goularte ( 1995 ) notes that when one student shows another how to do a task, he/she introduces the concept and allows the other to practice the skill and develop nurturing behaviors."

Pre-primary teachers are required to implement the National Curriculum for Pre-primary Education, which proposes two kinds of activities for the children:  ‘ free ’ activities, which are chosen and carried out by the children themselves without the direct involvement of the teacher, and  ‘ teacher-organized ’  activities, which are planned and organized by the teacher according to the objectives that have to be met. Teachers can organize activities on topics relating to phenomena that children encounter in every- day life or topics arising out of the children ’ s interests or questions. If the children ’ s inter- ests do not bring up issues which the teacher considers important and appropriate for pre- primary children, she/he can design activities to meet a selected objective, choosing the topic, content and instruction materials accordingly. Domains from which the topics for activities can be drawn include physics and outer space. The physics curriculum pro- poses topics relating to concepts such as weight, sound, light, motion, temperature and magnetism, basic characteristics of materials and properties of matter such as  fl oating/ sinking, melting, dissolving in water, etc. Space-related topics include Earth ’ s sphericity and motions and the phenomenon of day and night.

However, in a framework called  ‘ Flexible Zone of Activities, ’  the National Curriculum for Primary Education provides opportunities for innovative peda- gogical and didactical approaches (e.g. classes of children from different grades) and allows the introduction of concepts and phenomena that complement those introduced through the formal program and enhance the basic skills that the formal activities pro- posed by the curriculum are expected to develop. These may be related to experiences that children commonly encounter in everyday life. Teachers may also identify topics that they consider to be interesting, important and appropriate for children of speci fi c ages, which may not be included in the tight weekly timetable of the school program.

Mothers'  ex- pectations,  day care  quality  (Holloway  & Reichhart-Erickson,  1989),  and attending half-day rather  than full-day (Kalliopuska, 1991)  are also  related  to  children's  moral behavior ."

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,1,"In this study of the multiple determinants of professional caregiving, 237 caregivers (age range: 18–56 years) from 64 Dutch child care centers were extensively observed during their interactions with the children (0–4 years) in their usual care group. The choice of potential determinants of the caregiving quality was guided by Belsky’s [Belsky, J. (1984). The determinants of parenting: A process model.  Child Development, 55 , 83–96] model of the determinants of parenting. Consistent with Belsky’s model, quality of caregiving was found to be multiply determined by characteristics of the caregiver, the children and the caregiving context. More specifically, lower-quality care was provided by younger caregivers, to younger children, and by caregivers reporting higher physical occupational workloads. The differences between the participating child care centers proved to explain more variance in the quality of professional caregiving than the differences between the individual caregivers."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,1,"The quality of caregiving by professional caregivers in child care centers has been established as an important influence on various aspects of child development ( NICHD ECCRN, 2003 ,  NICHD ECCRN & Duncan, 2003 ). Many studies have been devoted to the quality of professional child care and its effects on the children’s well-being and development (for reviews see Lamb, 1998 ,  Vandell & Wolfe, 2000 ). Nevertheless, what determines the quality of caregiving behavior in professionals involved in the care of young children remains unclear. Ample studies have been dedicated to the explication of individual differences in  parental caregiving behavior and many were inspired by Belsky’s (1984)  seminal model of the determinants of parenting. The model assumes parenting to be shaped by multiple determinants in three domains: (1) parental personality or personal psychological resources, (2) child characteristics, and (3) contextual sources of stress and support. Because there was no theoretical model available for professional caregiving, Belsky’s model was used as a guideline for our choice of potential determinants. In keeping with the model, we hypothesized three groups of characteristics to multiply determine the quality of nonparental caregiving: (1) personal characteristics of the caregiver, (2) characteristics of the child care group, and (3) characteristics of the caregiving context. Before reporting on the present study, we will first elaborate our hypotheses with regard to each group of determinants within the perspective of earlier research."

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,2,"In parents, personal characteristics such as personality, age, and level of education have been found to affect the quality of caregiving ( Belsky & Barends, 2002 ,  Clark, Kochanska, & Ready, 2000 ,  Kochanska, Friesenborg, Lange, & Martel, 2004 ,  Van Bakel & Riksen-Walraven, 2002 ). Yet, very few studies have examined the effect of the personal characteristics of professional caregivers on the quality of their care and those that have, have done so with a quite restricted focus, i.e., the effects of their depressive symptoms. Similar to the findings in parents, results indicated that caregivers reporting more depressive symptoms displayed a lower-quality of caregiving behavior than those reporting fewer depressive symptoms ( Hamre & Pianta, 2004 ). In a previous study on the present sample of professional caregivers ( De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, Geurts, & Derksen, 2006 ), their self-reported general mood (i.e., optimism and happiness) was found to be significantly and positively related with the quality of their care as observed during a structured play episode. In the present study, caregiver general mood is also expected to show a relation with caregiver behavior in other caregiving situations."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,2,"The educational level of professional caregivers has also been frequently reported to be associated with the quality of the care provided ( Lamb, 1998 ,  Vandell & Wolfe, 2000 ). To date, this has not been confirmed for the Netherlands, which is possibly due to the restricted variance in the educational levels of the professional caregivers working in Dutch child care centers ( De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts, 2006 ,  Gevers Deynoot-Schaub & Riksen-Walraven, 2005 , Van IJzendoorn, Tavecchio, Stams, Verhoeven, & Reiling, 1998 ). In the Netherlands, most child care workers receive the same general vocational training, which does not specifically prepare them to work with very young children. Hence, much has to be learned from hands-on experience. Therefore, rather than caregiver education, in the present study we expected caregiver work experience to be related to the quality of professional caregiving as has earlier been observed by  Gevers Deynoot-Schaub and Riksen-Walraven (2005)  although this was not confirmed by other Dutch studies ( Van IJzendoorn et al., 1998, Vermeer et al., 2005 )."

In their study in Dutch child care centers,  Van IJzendoorn et al. (1998)  found a positive association between age and quality of caregiver behavior whereas another study failed to find such a relationship ( Gevers Deynoot-Schaub & Riksen-Walraven, 2005 ). For mothers, a positive association between age and quality of parenting has been found ( Moore & Brooks-Gunn, 2002 ). This was confirmed in a recent study by  Bornstein, Putnick, Suwalsky, and Gini (2006) , who demonstrated that the association between age and quality of parenting was particularly prominent among younger mothers. Given that many professional caregivers working in child care centers are relatively young as well, we also expected to find a positive association between caregiver age and quality of caregiver behavior in the present study."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,2,"Finally, we included the caregivers’ physical health as a potential determinant of their caregiving behavior. As caring for groups of young children in professional child care settings is generally considered to be strenuous and stressful, a good physical condition and the absence of health problems are crucial. Particularly in the field of care and education it is quite common, though, for staff to continue working when they are suffering from health problems ( Aronson, Gustafsson, & Dallner, 2000 ) and in various professions a negative relation between health problems and job performance has been found ( Roe, 2003 ). We anticipated a similar association in professional caregiving."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,2,"In parental caregiving studies, caregiver quality is investigated relative to the characteristics of individual children. Because in child care centers caregiver interactions mostly involve more than one child, we defined child characteristics at the level of the care group. For the purposes of the present study large group size, high child-caregiver ratio and younger mean age of the children were deemed relevant care group characteristics. The first two variables have been associated with lower-quality caregiving in numerous studies ( Vandell & Wolfe, 2000 ,  NICHD ECCRN, 2002a, b ). In an earlier study with the current sample, observations during a structured play session revealed that the quality of caregiver–child interactions was lower in the groups containing more children per caregiver (5 versus 3), especially when they included younger children ( De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts, 2006 ). We therefore expected all three aspects to also be associated with a lower-quality of caregiver behavior in situations other than structured play."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,"The third group of determinants, i.e., contextual characteristics, is of special interest in the field of professional child care. Surprisingly little attention has been awarded to the potential impact of the work environment of professional child care providers on the quality of their care, despite the wide recognition of the demands and stress involved in the job.  Phillips, Howes, and Whitebook (1991)  found more favorable working conditions to be related to a higher-quality of care. Moreover, they reported a positive relation between higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates on the one hand and quality of care on the other. Accordingly, in the present study we anticipated quantitative and qualitative workload in the workplace to be associated with lower-quality caregiving and, secondly, that supportive relations with colleagues and supervisors would positively affect the caregivers’ behavior toward the children.  Belsky’s postulation has been confirmed in numerous studies (for a review see  Cochran & Niego, 2002 ). Although we also took the support examined this association before, studies in the field of occupational psychology have shown that supportive relations with coworkers within the job setting boosted job performance in other professions ( AbuAlRub, 2004 ,  Beehr, Jex, Stacy, & Murray, 2000 )."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,"As mentioned above, we also assessed the caregivers’ home workload and support. Work-family interaction studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the work and home domain may affect each other both negatively and positively (for a review see  Geurts et al., 2005 ). In our study, we consequently hypothesized perceived home workload to be negatively related to the quality of care and support at home to contribute positively to the quality of care."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,"ToexaminethepotentialdeterminantsofthequalityofprofessionalcaregivinginchildcarecentersintheNetherlands we observed the behavior of a large cohort of caregivers toward the children in their care in three different situations: (1) during structured play with small groups of children, (2) during lunch with the complete care group, and (3) throughout a morning. As explained above, in line with  Belsky’s 1984 model of the determinants of parenting, we expected factors in three domains to independently contribute to the quality of professional caregiving. In sum, with regard to the first domain, i.e., the professional caregiver’s personal characteristics, we expected a higher-quality of caregiving to be associated with a better general mood, more professional experience, a higher age, and fewer health problems. As to the second domain, i.e., characteristics of the child care group, we expected higher-quality caregiving to occur in cases of lower child-caregiver ratios, smaller group sizes and older children. Finally, a propos the domain of contextual characteristics, in each of the three observed situations we expected higher-quality care in the case of lower workload and more support in the work context and at home."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,"Although we expected factors from the three domains to contribute to the quality of caregiver behavior in each of the three observed situations, we did not exclude the possibility that the contribution of individual factors to the quality of caregiver behavior might be different depending on the situation in which the caregiver–child interaction was observed. For example, workload and support experienced from colleagues may explain more variance in caregiver behavior as observed during everyday interactions with the children throughout an entire morning than during a relatively short structured play episode with a small group of children. We therefore decided to keep the three sitations apart and explore whether the behavior of the caregivers in the different situations was related to different combinations of predictors."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,"In the present study we observed different caregivers working in the same child care groups and caregivers from different groups in the same child care centers. This allowed us to use multilevel analysis to examine what part of the variance in the quality of caregiver behavior lies at the three different levels (i.e., the individual caregiver, the child care group, and the child care center), as well as how much variance at each of the levels is explained by the potential determinants. This information may be helpful in interpreting the possible effects of the specific predictors of caregiver behavior included in the present study, as well as in discussing possible sources of the variance that remains  un explained by the present predictors. We expected part of the variance in the behavior of the professional caregivers to lie at the level of the child care group and at the level of the child care center. That is because some of the influences that mold the quality of caregiver behavior may be group-specific (such as support from colleagues or age of the children in the care group) or center-specific (such as support from the supervisor or years of existence of the center). Because the"

A total of 170 valid videos  were obtained, including 85 videos from the mixed-age ( M age  = 58.99 months,  SD  = 10.09, 34% girls) classrooms and 85 from the same-age ( M age  = 57.74 months,  SD  = 10.84, 43% girls) classrooms. The results revealed that: (1) there was  a significant age effect in the frequency and duration of peer interactions, with  older children having more and longer interactions, (2) there was a significant  between-group difference in the duration of peer interactions, with MA having  a longer duration than SA, (3) there was a significant same-gender preference  with children preferring interacting with the same gender peers, (4) the MA  classrooms had significantly more positive interactions and significantly less  neutral and negative interactions than the SA classrooms, and (5) the MA class­ rooms engaged in significantly more dominating and less neutral interactions  than the SA ones.

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"Peer interactions provide opportunities for young children to gain social practice and experience and  to build healthy peer relationships, thus, they will eventually and profoundly impact their socio­ emotional development (Blerta,  2019 ). Peer interactions include those interactions between same-age  peers as well as between mixed-age peers. However, most preschool classrooms in the world are  arranged by age, thus only having same-age peer interactions, which are an important part of the daily  routine in early childhood programs. Consequently, young children in the same-age classrooms will be  suffering from the lacking of mixed-age peer interactions. This problem is more serious in China, as it  has implemented the only-child policy for 30 years and has made most Chinese children the only child  in their families (Li et al.,  2020 ). This means that these Chinese only children have been deprived of the  opportunities of having mixed-age peer interactions at home and in preschool, which will unfortu­ nately and negatively impact their social development (Zhang,  2004 ). Recently, some Chinese pre­ 2017 ). However, there might be significant differences in the peer interaction patterns between mixed-  age (MA) and same-age (SA) preschool classrooms (Wu,  2017 ). Accordingly, there is an urgent need  to explore the similarities and differences in the two types of peer interaction in the Chinese context,  thus providing educational implications for implementing the mixed-age classroom policy in China.  To fill this gap, this study videotaped and compared MA against SA classrooms in Chinese preschools,  aiming to reveal the pattern differences and the associated factors subsequently."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Peer interaction in the preschool classroom refers to the process in which young children exercise  action or influence on each other through verbal or non-verbal means (Li,  2011 ). Peer interactions and  peer relationships in a preschool classroom can significantly facilitate young children’s cognition,  language, and social skills (Baker-Sperry,  2007 , Rubin et al.,  2011 , Williford et al.,  2013 ). Positive peer  interactions can help children gain a sense of belonging and security, thus promoting their social  communication skills (Ryan,  2012 ) and psychological adaptability (Boivin,  2005 ). The existing studies  on peer interaction tend to focus on the value of peer interactions, the characteristics of peer  interactions, factors that influence peer interaction, and peer interaction skills intervention training.  It is believed that if educators are sufficiently equipped to support peer interactions within MA or SA  classrooms, it would be possible to maximize the positive peer influence (DeLay et al.,  2016 , Foster  et al.,  2020 )."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"The importance of peer interaction could be interpreted using Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory  (SCT), which views interaction as a necessary tool for creating a ZPD (zone of proximal development)  of a particular learner (Tomas,  2019 ). According to SCT, young children could develop cognitively and  socially through peer interactions (Vygotsky,  1978 ). As peer interactions can facilitate young chil­ dren’s learning and development in many domains, it is important, theoretically and practically, to  understand how peer interactions differ in mixed-age (MA) and same-age (SA) preschool classrooms.  Thus, this study reveals the differences in young children’s peer interactions within MA and SA  classrooms and the potential reasons for these differences and proposes pedagogical recommendations  for supporting peer interactions among young children."

In contrast, younger children are empowered to identify their zone of proximal development  and engage in activities beyond their cognitive levels. In addition, older children serve as role models  for younger children, thereby inducing younger children to exhibit prosocial behaviors in future  Thus, MA preschool classrooms can help facilitate peer interaction, enhancing young children’s social  and personality development."

This also provides a unique environment for  children to resolve cognitive conflicts with peers, thereby stimulating their social cognitive, and moral  developments (Azmitia,  1988 , Piaget,  1932 , Tudge,  1992 ). In contrast, MA preschool classrooms might  increase the hierarchical structure and level of complexity in group interactions, while SA classrooms  might have relatively equal and comparable young children around the same level. Therefore, peer  interactions in MA classrooms can provide opportunities for older children to practice and develop  prosocial, self-regulatory, and leadership skills, while younger children gain scaffolds for growth as  they receive help from older children (Winsler et al.,  2002 ). Compared to those in SA classrooms,  young children in MA classrooms have more play styles, more prosocial behaviors, and tend to depend  on peers rather than teachers in daily routine (Howes & Farver,  1987 , Mounts & Roopnarine,  1987 ).  Therefore, MA and SA preschool classrooms have different benefits for young children. Early child­ hood teachers need to capitalize on the benefits of peer interactions in different preschool classrooms  to facilitate young children’s early learning and development."

The existing literature has collectively demonstrated that MA classrooms could enable  2018 , Lillard,  2016 ). However, few studies have explored the unique impact of MA on only children in  the Chinese context. Unlike their counterparts in other countries, the young children in China are  primarily only-child in their families thus have no experiences of peer interaction at home (Li et al.,  2020 ). Chinese young children might have unique peer interaction patterns in MA preschool class­ rooms, as interacting with an elder or younger children might be rare. This study will fill this  research gap."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"The above literature review has revealed two research gaps. First, no studies have examined the peer  interactions in MA and SA preschool classrooms in China, where most young children have no  siblings thus have no experience of peer interactions at home. Second, very few studies have revealed  the differences and similarities in peer interactions between MA and SA classrooms, especially in  Chinese preschoolers. Given that more and more preschools are implementing MA classroom policy  in China, it is urgently needed to conduct a classroom observational study to compare MA and SA  classrooms’ peer interaction patterns. This will generate empirical evidence to showcase the nuanced  differences between MA and SA classrooms and their impacts on peer interactions. Therefore, this  study was dedicated to addressing the following questions with videotaped observations:"

However, what shapes the physical literacy environment remains unclear. In  this study, we drew on a sample of 895 4-year-olds across 223 classrooms  from the Professional Development Study and tested the role of classroom  age composition in shaping the physical literacy environment. Additionally,  we examined the extent to which the physical literacy environment  explained the associations between classroom age composition and emer­ gent literacy outcomes. We found that classrooms with a higher proportion  of younger children (2- or 3-year-olds) provide less book use, writing materi­ als, and writing around the room. Notably, the lack of writing displayed  around the room served as one potential reason why 4-year-olds demon­ strate smaller gains in expressive language skills in these classrooms.  Practice  or Policy:  Together, these findings highlight the need for investing in the  classroom physical literacy environment to ensure that it meets the needs of  all children in mixed-age classrooms."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,"Enrollment in high-quality preschool education improves childhood outcomes such as emergent  literacy acquisition, which has implications for long-term school success (Crawford,  1995 , Duncan  et al.,  2007 , Pullen & Justice,  2003 ). Among the many characteristics of a high-quality preschool  classroom, one important aspect is the physical literacy environment , which is commonly defined by  the reading and writing resources available in the classroom and how they are arranged (Altun et al.,   2018 , Guo et al.,  2012 ). Examples of physical literacy materials include books, writing utensils,  language-based puzzles, and alphabet displays. Additionally, certain classroom areas may be desig­ nated for reading and writing, while areas utilized for other subjects and activities could incorporate  these resources (Smith & Dickinson,  2002 ). Provision of these materials and areas can promote  children’s emergent literacy acquisition by allowing them to engage with language- and literacy-  related symbols and objects (Guo et al.,  2012 )."

Importantly, recent studies have shown that characteristics of children in the classroom are predictive  of the physical literacy environment. For instance, Guo et al. ( 2013 ) found that preschool classrooms  serving a higher percentage of dual language learners (DLLs) had a lower quality physical literacy  environment. Another important characteristic is the age composition of preschoolers, which varies  greatly in the United States (Moiduddin et al.,  2012 ). The age composition of classrooms has been"

Presumably, children’s ages may also  shape the ways in which teachers organize their classrooms and provide materials that support  emergent literacy acquisition. Therefore, in this study, we examine the extent to which: 1) classroom  age composition is associated with the classroom’s physical literacy environment, and 2) classroom age  composition is associated with children’s emergent literacy skill gains through the physical literacy  environment. Inquiry into these questions has implications for optimizing classroom environments  that can facilitate children’s emergent literacy learning in mixed-age classrooms."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Emergent literacy highlights that the development of literacy starts from an early age prior to formal  reading and writing instruction, with the term emergent literacy skills referring to a variety of  foundational skills that enable skilled and fluent reading and writing (Storch & Whitehurst,  2002 ,  Whitehurst & Lonigan,  1998 ). The current study focuses on four emergent literacy skills that have  been highlighted as the key instructional focus in the preschool period: Receptive and expressive  vocabulary and phonological awareness and print knowledge (Lonigan et al.,  2011 ). Although these  four skills are moderately to highly correlated (Cabell et al.,  2011 , Storch & Whitehurst,  2002 ), they are  also strong and independent predictors of reading and writing acquisition (Pullen & Justice,  2003 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Understanding and expressing vocabulary are skills strongly associated with early reading  (Dickinson et al.,  2019 ), with prior studies showing that weakness in receptive or expressive vocabu­ lary is associated with early decoding difficulties and later reading difficulties (Lee,  2011 , Ouellette,   2006 ). Phonological awareness, defined as the sensitivity to and ability to manipulate sound structure,  has also been found to be a significant predictor of reading skills (Castles & Coltheart,  2004 , Kendeou  et al.,  2009 ). Finally, children’s knowledge of the conventions and forms of written language, namely  print knowledge, has been found to predict reading acquisition even after controlling for phonological  awareness (Levy et al.,  2006 , National Early Literacy Panel,  2008 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Efforts to enhance children’s development through high-quality preschool experiences have primarily  focused on social interactions, as emphasized by Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological theory  (Bronfenbrenner & Morris,  1998 ). However, research has shown inconsistent associations between  preschool classroom social interactional quality and children’s emergent literacy skills (Burchinal,   2016 , Perlman et al.,  2016 ). Thus, there have been calls for attention to other aspects of classroom  experiences highlighted by bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner & Morris,  1998 ), such as the objects  and symbols available to children that play a unique and predictive role in their development (Wachs,   (Altun et al.,  2018 , Guo et al.,  2012 ), which includes the availability, display, and arrangement of  literacy materials, such as books, print sources, and writing instruments (Altun et al.,  2018 , Guo et al.,   2012 , Wolfersberger et al.,  2004 ). These calls reflect the fact that the literacy environment is not only  predictive of children’s outcomes, but is more malleable than teachers’ social interactions (Markussen-  Brown et al.,  2017 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"When considering the physical literacy environment, there are several theoretical explanations that  shed light on how and why the physical literacy environment may shape children’s emergent literacy  learning. Bioecological theory suggests that the organization, structure, and complexity of the physical  environment not only stimulates solitary interactions with objects and symbols, but also provides  conditions and stimuli for interpersonal interactions involving literacy-related instruction and mod­ eling (Bronfenbrenner & Morris,  2006 ). In addition, sociocultural theory emphasizes that children’s  internalization and use of symbols and signs are first supported by the presence of props and object-  orientated play, which involves physical interaction with objects and materials (Vygotsky,  1978 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Taken together, the physical literacy environment can directly elicit literacy-related exploration,  manipulation, elaboration, and imagination in children’s solitary activities. It can also prompt adult-  mediated literacy enriched play where teachers model and scaffold children’s use of physical literacy  resources (Christie & Enz,  1992 , Neuman & Roskos,  1993 , Vukelich,  1991 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"There are several ways to characterize the classroom physical literacy environment. Classrooms  with a rich physical literacy environment have numerous and varied book materials, literacy areas,  writing materials, and teacher- and child-directed writing displays and props around the classroom.  (e.g., rhyming texts, alphabet books, flap books), related to different curriculum themes, and are  arranged in different activity centers (e.g., dramatic play areas, the block center, the science table,  Justice,  2006 ). In addition, high-quality classrooms provide designated areas with writing tools and  materials that promote writing and model writing (e.g., newspapers, maps, Guo et al.,  2012 , Neuman &  Roskos,  1990 ), as well as examples of teacher- and child-directed writing and print products used to  guide daily learning experiences (e.g., signs, posters, writing samples, Guo et al.,  2012 , Phillips et al.,   2008 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Classrooms that are rich in literacy materials and areas have been found to increase the frequency,  duration, and complexity of literacy-related play (Neuman & Roskos,  1990 ,  1992 ). For example,  children in intervention classrooms that were enriched with literacy objects in targeted play areas  (e.g., the cozy corner library) were observed to spend more time engaging in reading and writing  activities, incorporate literacy objects in more diverse and functional ways, and use more explicit  language than the nonintervention group (Neuman & Roskos,  1992 ). In another study, classrooms  with high-quality classroom physical literacy environments were strongly associated with children’s  general literacy interest and engagement in literacy activities. These factors, in turn, predicted their  phonological awareness and expressive vocabulary (Baroody & Diamond,  2016 ). Several studies  further demonstrate direct associations between the physical literacy environment and emergent  literacy acquisition. For example, Arteaga et al. ( 2019 ) found a positive association between engaging  with a high-quality physical literacy environment and children’s print knowledge. Similarly, other  studies have found that the quality of the classroom literacy area is significantly associated with  children’s alphabet knowledge and name-writing abilities (Guo et al.,  2012 , Zhang et al.,  2015 ) as well  as expressive and receptive vocabulary and phonological awareness (Altun et al.,  2018 ). These findings  suggest that there are links between features of the physical literacy environment and children’s  emergent literacy skills (Altun et al.,  2018 , Guo et al.,  2012 , Palmer et al.,  2018 , Xu et al.,  2014 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Despite promising evidence that the physical literacy environment is important for children’s early  emergent literacy skills, there is limited research on factors that may shape the literacy environment.  However, existing research suggests that the physical literacy environment is malleable. For example,  interventions aimed at improving teachers’ language instruction and implementation of language-  focused curricula have shown significant positive changes in the quality of the classroom literacy  environment (Arteaga et al.,  2019 , Palmer et al.,  2018 ). Although promising, more inquiry is needed  into what influences the classroom literacy environment and how those factors are related to young  children’s emergent literacy skills."

Although it is undoubtedly shaped by larger contextual forces (e.g., program  funding), understanding more proximal predictors is also important. Mirroring the bidirectional  relations between a person and their context proposed by bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner &  Morris,  1998 ), the physical literacy environment can influence children’s emergent literacy learning  while simultaneously being shaped by the collective characteristics of children within a classroom.  These characteristics may influence teachers’ perceptions and beliefs about the developmental needs"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"and interests of children, which in turn, influences their provision of a high quality physical literacy  environment. For example, the classroom language composition (as measured by the percentage of  DLLs within the classroom) has been found to be significantly associated with the quality of the  physical literacy environment and instruction, such that classrooms serving a larger proportion of  DLLs were rated as having a lower quality literacy environment (Guo et al.,  2013 , Justice et al.,  2008 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Another notable feature of classrooms that may shape the literacy environment is the ages of  children, commonly referred to as classroom age composition (Moller et al.,  2008 ). Given the less  formal regulations around preschool in the United States, mixed-age classrooms, which include  children of multiple age groups, are widely used. For example, according to national statistics, over  75% of children in Head Start, the largest publicly funded preschool program in the United States, are  enrolled in mixed-age classrooms serving both 3- and 4-year-olds (Moiduddin et al.,  2012 ). National  data also reveal that roughly 65% of preschool classrooms, including those in publicly funded  programs, have over a 12-month age difference between the oldest and youngest children, with 35%  reporting an age difference of 18 months or greater (National Survey of Early Care and Education,   2012 ). These findings underscore the considerable enrollment of preschoolers in mixed-age class­ rooms, although the distribution of children in different age groups varies across states and programs  (Ansari et al.,  2016 ). Therefore, the current study focuses on the variation in the percentage of children  in each age group as indicators of classroom age composition."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Classroom age composition is an important factor to consider because it has been shown to shape  children’s school performance, including their acquisition of emergent literacy skills (e.g., Ansari et al.,   2016 , Justice et al.,  2019 , Moller et al.,  2008 ). A preliminary pattern identified in previous studies  suggests that older children in classrooms with a higher proportion of younger peers may gain less in  emergent literacy skills, corresponding to 2 to 5 months of academic development (Ansari et al.,  2016 ).  However, the mechanisms that link classroom age composition to children’s learning are still unclear.  and the variability in classroom age composition. Moreover, the factors that link classroom age  composition and children’s learning can inform interventions that seek to optimize children’s learning  in mixed-age settings."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"As part of the current study, we propose that the classroom physical literacy environment may  function as a potential mechanism through which classroom age composition shapes children’s  emergent literacy learning. There is indirect evidence regarding links between classroom age compo­ sition and teachers’ practices that lends support to this hypothesis. For example, Ansari and Pianta  ( 2019 ) found that greater classroom age diversity creates challenges for teachers to provide children  with high quality emotional and instructional support. As another example, teachers serving class­ rooms with a larger proportion of younger children have been found to provide less opportunity for  children to engage in group and academic instruction (Ansari,  2017 ). Similarly, classroom age  composition may also shape the classroom physical literacy environment due to teachers’ beliefs  about young children’s literacy learning and development, which is discussed below."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Preschool teachers may believe younger children do not need access to the same rich  physical literacy environment compared to older children (Lynch,  2009 ). For example,  a study of Head Start teachers revealed that teachers often believed that young children  should only engage with literacy materials after mastering social-behavioral skills, such as  following directions, abiding by classroom rules, and relating to peers (Powell et al.,  2008 ).  Teachers’ beliefs about the degree to which children should learn emergent literacy skills at  young ages have been found to be positively associated with the amount of teachers’ language  and literacy-related instructional practices (Schachter et al.,  2016 ). Therefore, teachers with the  above-mentioned beliefs may provide fewer literacy-related materials and spaces when teach­ ing in classrooms with a higher percentage of younger children. For example, in a classroom  with more 3-year-olds, teachers may provide books with less engaging and complex narratives,  and fewer writing materials (e.g., pencils, papers, word cards, templates), and writing dis­ played around the room (e.g., signs, posters, charts, and children’s writing displays). The"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"lesser provision of literacy-related materials and space in classrooms with more younger  children may be especially distinct when it comes to writing-related materials and space.  There is evidence showing that although most teachers agreed with research concerning  what language and literacy skills children should know in preschool, 30% did not believe  spelling knowledge or that these children learn to write by watching teachers write  (Hindman & Wasik,  2008 )."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"However, the above-mentioned beliefs are contrary to the emergent literacy-related research  and theories which have established that children as young as three years of age are able to  develop emergent literacy skills (Puranik & Lonigan,  2011 , Whitehurst & Lonigan,  1998 ).  Inadequate access to literacy-stimulating environments in preschool classrooms has been  associated with preschoolers’ smaller gains in emergent literacy skills (Altun et al.,  2018 , Guo  et al.,  2012 ). Given the potential variation in classroom physical literacy environments based on  the ages of children within the classroom and their influence on children’s emergent literacy  development, we hypothesize that classroom physical literacy environments may mediate the  associations between classroom age composition and children’s emergent literacy development."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"Given the importance and malleability of the classroom physical literacy environment for children’s  emergent literacy learning, it is critical to investigate the factors that may influence it. Because  children’s characteristics including age may shape teachers’ beliefs and practices about what to provide  in the classroom environments (Ansari,  2017 , Guo et al.,  2013 ), we focus on classroom age composi­ tion as one potential factor that influences the physical literacy environment. Additionally, because the  physical literacy environment has been theoretically and empirically suggested as a predictor of  children’s literacy learning (Altun et al.,  2018 , Bronfenbrenner & Morris,  2006 ), we also examine  aspects of the physical literacy environment as potential mediators that may explain associations  between classroom age composition and children’s emergent literacy outcomes (Ansari et al.,  2016 ,  Moller et al.,  2008 ). Specifically, we examine: (1) the extent to which classroom age composition is  associated with the classroom physical literacy environment, and (2) whether the classroom physical  literacy environment accounts for the associations between classroom age composition and children’s  emergent literacy acquisition. We hypothesize that children may gain less in emergent literacy skills in  classrooms with a higher percentage of younger peers as teachers may fail to provide a high-quality  and age-appropriate physical literacy environment for them.

The moderating role of the class­ room ’ s age composition (e.g., 3- and 4-year-olds versus 4-year-olds only) also was examined.  Using a dataset of 852 3-year-old children and 1114 4-year-old children, classroom-level problem  behaviors were operationalized using teacher reports of children ’ s problem behaviors. Results  indicated that classroom-level problem behaviors, specifically oppositional/aggressive and  internalizing behavior, were associated with lower teacher-child interaction quality (i.e.,  emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support). In contrast, classroom-  level hyperactivity was only negatively related to classroom instructional support. Moderation  results indicated that high-levels of classroom-level activity were related to lower-levels of  teacher-child interaction quality, but for 4-year-old only classrooms. The results of this study have  implications for practice and policy."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,1,"At times, preschool behavioral difficulties reduce opportunities for children to engage successfully in classroom activities that are  fundamental for their development and learning ( Hemmeter et al., 2006 ). Approximately 30% of low-income preschool children have  been reported to exhibit moderate to clinically significant emotional and behavioral needs ( Barbarin, 2007 ,  Feil et al., 2005 ),  potentially indicating that within Head Start classrooms, which serve children from low-income backgrounds, as many as four or five  children in a classroom of 18 may demonstrate problem behaviors. In addition to directly undermining a child ’ s learning, child  problem behaviors may also be negatively associated with overall teacher-child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,1,"Teacher-child interaction quality, one of the most critical drivers of children ’ s learning and social-emotional development within  preschool classrooms, may be influenced by the level of problem behavior displayed (e.g.,  Burchinal, 2018 ,  Pianta et al., 2016 ). High  rates of classroom-level problem behaviors are negatively correlated with aspects of teacher-child interaction quality, such as teachers ’  ability to execute instructional activities as planned due to time and attention being devoted continuously to dealing with behavioral  issues ( Friedman-Krauss et al., 2014 ). Researchers and policymakers focus on the roles of teachers (e.g., qualifications, training) in  teacher-child interaction quality, however, little work has considered how characteristics of children themselves, including their  ability to regulate their behavior, may influence the quality of their schools, despite evidence that children themselves contribute to  the classroom environment ( Coelho et al., 2019 ,  LoCasale-Crouch et al., 2007 ,  Mashburn et al., 2006 )."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"Due to the importance of teacher-child interaction quality on children ’ s learning and development, this study aimed to understand  how children ’ s behavior at an aggregate level was related to teacher-child interaction quality.

This study aimed to elucidate how problem behaviors, averaged across children in a  classroom, contributed to teacher-child interaction quality in mixed-age Head Start classrooms and classrooms serving 4-year-olds  only. Results from this study can assists Head Start and other preschool programs better understand how children ’ s behaviors may  be related to teacher-child interaction quality. Practically, these findings provide ideas for potential professional development and  ongoing support for teachers that can help them manage problem behavior and improve the overall teacher-child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"Teacher-child interaction quality is one of the most important contributors to children ’ s social and academic development during  preschool ( Burchinal, 2018 ,  Burchinal et al., 2015 ). High-quality preschools influence children ’ s learning and development in various  domains, including children ’ s motivation to learn, socioemotional and behavioral skills, and development of positive peer relation­ ships ( La Paro et al., 2004 ,  Schmitt et al., 2018 ). Teacher-child interaction quality is characterized by teachers ’  practices and behaviors  such as their social interactions with children and instructional practices ( Pianta et al., 2008 ). Three domains of teacher-child  interaction quality are recognized as critical contributors to children ’ s learning and development: (a) emotional support, (b) class­ room organization, and (c) instructional support ( Hamre et al., 2014 ).  Emotional support  is characterized by warm, sensitive,  responsive, and individualized interactions.  Classroom organization  is defined as how well teachers structure and manage classroom  activities, routines, and materials to support children ’ s self-regulation, attention, and engagement in learning. Finally,  instructional  support reflects a teacher ’ s use of cognitively stimulating practices with children, such as encouraging problem-solving, higher-order  reasoning, and more advanced language ( La Paro et al., 2004 ). To date, a substantial literature has examined predictors of quality at  the program- and teacher-level in preschool settings (e.g.,  Manning et al., 2019 ,  Tout et al., 2006 ), but rarely has the association with  children ’ s behavior and teacher-child interaction quality been examined."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"In the literature, the two types of problem behaviors that typically are examined include externalizing behaviors and internalizing  behaviors (e.g.,  Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2005 ,  Williford  &  Wolcott, 2015 ). In the present study, we examined three teacher-reported  problem behaviors: (a) oppositional/aggressive, (b) hyperactivity, and (c) internalizing behavior. Children ’ s oppositional/aggres­ sive behaviors (often conceptualized as a component of externalizing behavior) are characterized by overt hostility, conduct problems,  and oppositional defiance behaviors ( Whitcomb, 2013 ). Extant research shows that children who exhibit oppositional/aggressive  behaviors are less likely to engage successfully in classroom activities ( Moffett  &  Morrison, 2020 ,  Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2005 ). Hy­ peractive behaviors such as impulsivity and inattention frequently are operationalized as a dimension of externalizing behavior (along  with oppositional/aggressive) in preschool (e.g.,  Montroy et al., 2014 ,  Williford  &  Wolcott, 2015 ). However, research suggests that  even though oppositional/aggressive and hyperactive behaviors correlate, they are distinct dimensions of problem behavior and have  different implications for children ’ s academic and social functioning ( Gustafsson et al., 2018 ). Internalizing behaviors, such as extreme  shyness, social withdrawal, and anxiety, are described as directed towards the self ( Whitcomb, 2013 ). Children who exhibit inter­ nalizing behaviors are often unable to form strong peer relationships and are more likely to engage in isolating behaviors and social  withdrawal (e.g.,  Oland  &  Shaw, 2005 )."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"Extant research focuses on how teacher-child interaction quality relates to children ’ s skills and behavior. For example, emotionally  supportive, well-managed, and higher-quality instructional classrooms reduce individual children ’ s problem behaviors (e.g.,  Hamre  &  Pianta, 2005 ,  La Paro et al., 2004 ). However, the reverse relationship (i.e., the extent to which children ’ s problem behaviors influence  the quality of teacher-child interaction quality) is under-researched. To conceptualize the role that problem behaviors at the  classroom-level may have on teacher-child interaction quality, we draw upon the literature on transactional models, which posits that  development is a consequence of the ongoing dynamic interaction between children and their environment ( Sutherland  &  Oswald,  2005 ). Although we did not test the bidirectional relationship between problem behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality, this  teacher-child interaction quality.  &  Kiuru, 2015 ). First, problem behavior displayed by children can negatively affect teacher-child relationships and place an extra  burden or stress on teachers. This stress can evoke negative affective, behavioral, and cognitive responses in teachers towards (all)  children ( Nurmi  &  Kiuru, 2015 ), undermining teacher-child interaction quality by introducing a  “ burnout cascade ”  response from  teachers in which children ’ s behaviors and teachers ’  responses to their behaviors continue to worsen over time and teacher-child"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"interaction quality declines ( Jennings  &  Greenberg, 2009 ). Second, children ’ s problem behaviors also can influence peers to exhibit  problem behaviors (i.e., a contagion effect) whereby children ’ s problem behaviors encourage behavior problems among their peers  ( Bulotsky-Shearer et al., 2012 ,  Rojas et al., 2020 )."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Teacher-child interaction quality may vary depending on the type of classroom-level problem behavior displayed. As posited by the  burnout cascade theory, teachers tend to feel more negative and stressed when they perceive aggression/opposition behavior in the  classroom, leading to anger and frustration because these behaviors hamper their teaching ability ( Bosman et al., 2019 ). Moreover,  following the contagion theory, children also exhibit more aggression/opposition when in classrooms with higher levels of aggression/  opposition ( Thomas et al., 2011 ). Classroom-level aggression/opposition often inhibits teachers ’  ability to provide consistent  emotional support and positive behavior management ( Zinsser et al., 2013 ) and reduces the available instructional time ( Long et al.,  2018 ). However, contrary to other prior research,  Friedman-Krauss et al. (2014)  found that higher levels of child aggression/oppo­ sition behavior problems in the fall were related to higher classroom emotional climate in the spring, over and above fall emotional  climate and child-, teacher-, and classroom-level covariates. These mixed results suggest that more work is needed to understand the  relationship between classroom-level aggression/opposition and teacher-child interaction quality, considering research suggesting  that aggression/opposition behaviors are related to more negative behaviors among peers and teachers, we posited an exploratory  hypothesis that higher levels of classroom aggression/opposition behavior may be negatively related to the emotional climate and  classroom organization."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Like the extant literature on classroom-level aggression/opposition, there are mixed findings regarding the relationship between  classroom-level hyperactivity and teacher-child interaction quality. In  Partee et al. (2020) , classroom-level hyperactivity was nega­ tively related to classroom management ( β  = − 0.15,  p  =  0.04) and instructional support ( β = − 0.19,  p  =  0.01) and marginally related to  negative emotional support at the end of the year. However, in  Bosman et al. (2019) , teachers reported using more sensitive practices  when responding to individual children ’ s hyperactive behaviors in the classroom. Teachers ’  increased sensitivity for hyperactive  behaviors among children may be due to greater awareness about hyperactivity and symptoms of ADHD and when teachers understand  what children are not able to or otherwise struggle to control their behavior in the classroom, this may influence the sensitivity of their  teaching in a positive way ( Chang  &  Davis, 2009 ). Given these mixed results, we hypothesized that higher rates of classroom-level  hyperactivity would be negatively related to emotional support and classroom organization."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Less attention has been paid to the association between children ’ s internalizing behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality.  Compared to children with more disruptive problem behaviors like externalizing and hyperactivity behaviors, children with inter­ nalizing symptoms often receive less attention from teachers because their problems are less apparent and more difficult to detect  ( Berg-Nielsen et al., 2012 ). Yet, teachers who do not aid and comfort children struggling with internalizing problems may increase  children ’ s anxiety withdrawal symptoms, which can negatively impact teacher-child interaction quality ( Jeon et al., 2019 ).  Buyse et al.  (2008)  found that higher average levels of internalizing behavior in the classroom significantly predicted more relational conflict  between teachers and children, suggesting that classroom-level internalizing behavior may negatively affect emotional support.  Children ’ s internalizing behavior, which is in part a function of children ’ s ability to manage emotional distress, is expected to be most  strongly linked to the quality of emotional support in the classroom."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Children ’ s behavior and teacher-child interaction quality may unfold and interact differently in classrooms serving older children  versus classrooms serving children across a broader age range. For example, although some Head Start programs serve 3- and 4-year-  olds in separate classrooms, most Head Start programs combine 3- and 4-year-olds in mixed-age classrooms ( Ansari  &  Pianta, 2019 ).  However, to our knowledge, only Guo et al. (2014)  investigated interrelations among age composition, teacher-child interaction  quality, and children ’ s skills and found that mixed-age classrooms were beneficial for preschoolers, but only when coupled with high-  quality interactions. In addition, prior studies have not examined, to our knowledge, the extent to which the age grouping of class­ rooms (same-age or mixed-age) interacts with classroom-level problem behaviors to contribute to teacher-child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"We predicted that mixed-age classrooms would moderate the relationship between classroom-level problem behaviors and teacher-  child interaction quality based on the theoretical and limited empirical literature. However, the direction of the hypothesis remained  exploratory given the limited prior research and theory. It is plausible that the negative association between classroom-level problem  behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality may be even more pronounced in mixed-age classrooms than in classrooms serving 4-  year-olds where the association may be less pronounced or non-existent. Prior studies suggest that managing a classroom with a wide  range of ages and diverse needs can be challenging ( Guo et al., 2014 ) and uniquely stressful to teachers ( Friedman-Krauss et al., 2014 ).  A mixed-age classroom with a broader range of behaviors and developmental skills could be negatively related to a teacher ’ s ability to  provide high-quality instructional support, emotional support, and classroom organization. For example,  Ansari and Pianta (2019)  found that teachers who taught in mixed-age classrooms demonstrated less optimal teacher-child interaction quality. Therefore, it is  plausible that mixed-age grouping is negatively related to teacher-child interaction quality ( Ansari  &  Pianta, 2019 ), that classroom-  level problem behaviors are negatively related to teacher-child interaction quality ( Partee et al., 2020 ), and that these challenges  are magnified when in combination, resulting in lower teacher-child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"In contrast, we might find that the associations between classroom-level problem behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality  were less pronounced in mixed-age classrooms than in classrooms serving 4-year-olds only. Drawing upon developmental theories, we  hypothesized that what was developmentally normative  –  and teachers ’  expectations about what was developmentally normative  –  for  a 3-year-old may be different from what was normative for a 4-year-old ( Chang  &  Davis, 2009 ). Prior studies have demonstrated that  teachers are likely to feel frustrated or angry towards children when they feel like the child could have controlled their behavior"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,"( Bosman et al., 2019 ,  Chang  &  Davis, 2009 ). It is plausible that teachers may perceive behavioral challenges and react to them  differently in mixed-age classrooms versus classrooms serving only 4-year-olds. For instance, in mixed-age classrooms, 3-year-old  perceive that behavior as more developmentally appropriate, they may warmly comfort those children, which is associated with higher  quality classrooms. Conversely, more classroom-level problem behaviors in 4-year-old only classrooms may be related to lower  teacher-child interaction quality because teachers see oppositional/aggressive, hyperactivity, and internalizing behaviors as inap­ propriate for 4-year-olds. In other words, expectations about children in mixed-age classrooms may have buffered preschool teachers  against the difficulties of handling more behavioral challenging classrooms. However, no studies to our knowledge have explored this  hypothesis."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,"The goal of the present study was to advance our understanding of the relation between classroom-level problem behavior and  teacher-child interaction quality within a diverse sample of Head Start programs and the potential for mixed-age classrooms, one of the  most common models of preschool programs, to increase or decrease the challenges of teaching in classrooms with high-levels of  classroom problem behavior. The following research questions were examined:"

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,(2) To what extent are the relations between fall baseline classroom-level problem behaviors and spring post teacher-child  interaction quality moderated by classroom age composition?
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,"Given the mixed findings in the literature, we heavily relied upon our theoretical frameworks and prior studies to propose the  following exploratory hypotheses: (a) higher levels of classroom oppositional/aggressive behavior would be negatively related to  emotional support and classroom organization, (b) higher levels of classroom hyperactivity would be negatively related to emotional  support and classroom organization, and (c) higher levels of classroom internalizing behaviors would be negatively related to  emotional support. It is important to note that we have no hypotheses about the effects of mean classroom problem behaviors on  instructional support. For Research Question 2, due to limited existing research, we posited an exploratory hypothesis that teacher-  child interaction quality would be moderated by classroom age composition such that mixed-age classrooms with higher classroom  level problem behaviors would show more negative teacher-child interaction quality relative to 4-year-old only classrooms."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,1,We observed the play of 32 toddlers and preschoolers randomly assigned to eight
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,1,"play groups. Four of the play groups contained children of the same age, the other  four contained children who were 2 years apart in age. No differences were found  in overall patterns of play as measured by Parten's (1932) play codes. Although  negative behaviors occurred infrequently in both settings, younger children tended to  exhibit more negative interactions in same-age settings, and older children exhibited  more negative interactions in mixed-age settings. Younger children in mixed-age  settings played with same-age and older playmates at expected rates, older children  in mixed-age settings, however, were more likely to choose other older children as  playmates. The results, which differ to some extent from previous research, may be  due to the familiarity of children with peers within the group and common day-care  experiences prior to the study."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,1,"The importance of age and competence in social development has led researchers  to question the relative merits of same-age versus mixed-age groups with respect  to children's social behavior. Although it has been argued that mixed-age groups  are more consistent with human evolution in the context of small hunter-gatherer  societies (Konner, 1975), same-age groups are predominant in complex, indus-  trialized societies (Hartup, 1976). It has been noted that most studies of chil-  dren's social development have been conducted in same-age environments  (Lougee, Grueneich, & Hartup, 1977). Consequently, much of our knowledge  about social behavior and development may be context-specific."

For example, same-age groups may do a better job of  preparing children for school settings, which are almost invariably same-age in  composition. Older children may be able to engage in more extended and com-  plex activities when they are not interrupted by younger children. In addition,  teachers may find same-age settings to be easier because they do not have to plan  and prepare activities for children of diverse developmental levels. Conversely,  mixed-age settings provide opportunities for younger children to learn by observ-  ing competent older peers. Older children may be more likely to learn and  practice helping behaviors in mixed-age settings. Furthermore, it could be argued  that while same-age groups may prepare children for success in school, mixed-  age groups are more relevant to life outside of school."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,2,"Several studies have investigated the extent to which the social behavior of  young children is influenced by the age composition of groups. Three laboratory  studies have observed dyads of children grouped according to various ages.  Lougee et al. (1977), for example, observed same- and mixed-age dyads of 3-and  4-year-olds. Younger same-age dyads exhibited the lowest amount of positive  social interaction, whereas older same-age dyads displayed the most. Intermedi-  ate levels were observed in the mixed-age dyads. A similar pattern was observed  for mean length of utterance. Task orientation did not differ among the groups.  Howes and Farver (1987) studied dyads in which 2-year-olds were paired either  with same-age or 5-year-old partners. Toddlers engaged in more social pretend  play when paired with the older children. Brownell (1990) observed dyads of 18-  and 24-month-old toddlers and found that the younger children were more inter-  active and more positive when paired with an older child than with an age-mate.  They initiated more, produced more complex initiations, and imitated older  partners more than same-age peers. Older children, on the other hand, made  fewer initiations in mixed-age dyads, when they did initiate, however, it was  likely to be longer and more complex than with same-age peers."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,2,"Three additional studies have examined play behaviors in the context of larger  child-care groups. Goldman (1981) observed naturally occurring classes consist-  ing either of 3-year-olds, 4-year-olds, or a mixture of 3- and 4-year-olds. The  4-year-olds in mixed-age groups spent more time in solitary play but less time in  parallel play or teacher-directed activities than did their counterparts in same-age  groups. Three-year-olds in mixed-age groups spent less time in parallel play than  3-year-olds in same-age groups. Within the mixed-age groups, playmate choices  were more likely to be influenced by the partner's gender rather than age. Field  (1982) observed same- and mixed-age groups and reported that mixed-age  groups resulted in more verbal interaction, imitation, and fantasy play. Urberg  and Kaplan (1986) found more interactive-functional play in mixed-age groups  for all children, but more conversation and parallel-functional interaction in  same-age groups. Younger children engaged in more dramatic play and negative  interactions in mixed-age groups."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,3,"Other studies have observed older children or have noted unplanned observa-  tions of possible differences between same- and mixed-age groupings. Graziano,  French, Brownell, and Hartup (1976), in a study of task performance in same-  and mixed-age triads of first- and third-graders, found more conversations in  same-age triads. Whiting and Whiting (1975) suggested that aggression is more  likely in same-age groups, whereas nurturing behaviors are more commonly  observed in mixed-age groups."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,3,"The research conducted thus far is limited in several respects. The laboratory  studies have relied on observations of dyads of children who were not previously  acquainted. Because Mueller and Brenner (1977) showed that acquainted tod-  dlers were more likely to interact with each other in a sustained fashion than  nonacquainted peers, the question is raised of whether this research would gener-  alize to the typical day-care or play group context consisting of more children, all  of whom are acquainted with each other. The group studies, however, have not  randomly assigned children to conditions or standardized observational environ-  ments or adult roles. For example, in Field's (1982) study, each same-age group  contained 8 children, whereas the mixed-age groups contained 24 children.  Goldman's (1981) study required only 80% of the children in the classes to be  within the designated age ranges, thus reducing the likelihood of differences  between settings. Only two studies were found that included children under 3  years of age (Brownell, 1990, Howes & Farver, 1987). The definition of  mixed-  age has varied widely across studies, with differences as little as 6 months  between older and younger children (Brownell, 1990) and as great as 3 years  (Howes & Farver, 1987). The outcomes assessed have varied widely across the  studies, measuring effects on domains such as overall social behavior, differenti-  ated levels of social play, pretend play, task performance, and task orientation.  Although this variability reflects the diversity of possible effects, replication of  findings within each outcome domain is essential."

Caregiver-child interactions in nine childcare groups were observed over four mornings ( N  observation cycles  = 144). The results from multilevel structural equation modelling showed that wide age range and a higher number of very young children present were related to lower quality of observed behavioural, emotional and learning support.

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,2,"There is a large research  fi eld investigating the role of childcare in children ’ s learning, social-emotional development and psychosocial adjustment. Most studies on these associations suggest that spending time in high-quality childcare has a positive impact on child outcomes (Ahnert & Lamb,  2011 , Burchinal, Vandergrift, Pianta, & Mashburn,  2010 , Campbell, Pungello, Miller- Johnson, Burchinal, & Ramey,  2001 , Duncan,  2003 , NICHD,  2006 , Tietze et al., 2012 , Vandell, Belsky, Burchinal, Steinberg, & Vandergrift,  2010 ). Childcare quality is considered to be a multidimensional construct that can be mea- sured by assessing both structural and process characteristics (Howes et al., 2008 , Layzer & Goodson,  2006 , Boo, Araujo, & Tomé,  2016 , Phillips, Mekos, Scarr, McCartney, & Abbott – Shim,  2000 ).

Moreover, childcare researchers emphasize high-quality social interac- tions between caregiver and children as the most important determinant of the quality of early education and care (Burchinal et al.,  2010 , Curby, Brock, & Hamre,  2013 , Curby et al.,  2009 , Howes et al.,  2008 , Mashburn et al.,  2008 , Peisner-Feinberg et al.,  2001 , Wilson, Pianta, & Stuhlman,  2007 )."
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,3,"A number of studies have investigated the relation between structural characteristics and process quality based on the assumption that structural childcare quality predicts how teachers provide care and education, and whether they are sensitive, reliable, and emotionally available for children. Some studies provided evidence that positive caregiving was more common when group size and child-adult ratio were smaller (Cryer, Tietze, Burchinal, Leal, & Palacios,  1999 , Helmerhorst, Riksen-Walraven, Gevers Deynoot- Schaub, Tavecchio, & Fukkink,  2015 , NICHD,  2006 , Phillips et al.,  2000 , Reyhing, Frei, Burkhardt Bossi, & Perren,  2019 ). Caregiver education and training have also been found to be associated with higher quality caregiver skills (Burchinal, Cryer, Cli ff ord, & Howes,  2002 , Burchinal, Howes, & Kontos, 2002 , Campbell & Milbourne,  2005 , Fukkink & Lont,  2007 , Perren et al.,  2017 ). Other studies, however, have found only weak associations between child- care structural quality and caregiving quality, or have failed to con fi rm these associations at all (Burchinal et al.,  2002 , Gialamas et al.,  2014 , Howes et al., 2008 , Pianta et al.,  2005 , Slot et al.,  2015 )."

Such family-like programmes are highly  fl exible and require fewer sta ff , classrooms, and schedules.

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,4,"peer-group age compositions in the context of early education and childcare, since only a few countries (e.g., Germany, the Netherlands) adopt an extended age range and include children under the age of three in regular preschool classes (Helmerhorst et al.,  2015 , Sommer & Sechtig,  2016 ). Most previous studies comparing multi-age and same-age settings focused on children ’ s behavioural outcomes, while research on associations between peer-group age composition and caregiver behaviour is very limited. Overall, research provides evidence that caregiving in mixed-age groups is of lower quality (Tietze et al.,  2013 ). Sundell ( 1994 ) found that age range negatively in fl uenced the quality of interaction between preschool teachers and chil- dren. Teachers provided fewer teacher-guided activities and less elaborated instructions in groups with a wide age range. Sommer and Sechtig ( 2016 ) have shown that the extension of the age range in the group is a strong predictor of lower interaction quality between caregivers and children. To ally included the number of children aged under 36 months in the analysis and showed that the presence of even a single child younger than 36 months of age had a negative impact on the quality of caregiving (Sommer & Sechtig, 2016 ). This result is consistent with the  fi ndings of a Dutch study that investigated mixed-age groups comprising children aged from 0 to 4 years (de Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts,  2007 ). The study indicated that the number of infants in the group is a signi fi cant predictor of caregiving quality: groups with fewer children aged under 24 months receive a better quality of care. A further study in a Dutch childcare context demonstrated that both caregivers ’  sensitive responsiveness and their educational skills were lower in infant groups (0 – 2 years) than in preschool groups (2 – 4 years) or even in mixed-age groups (0 – 4 years, Helmerhorst et al.,  2015 ). Some studies recog- nizing age composition as a potential determinant of caregiver behaviour in childcare centres reported that a higher mean age in the childcare group correlates with higher-quality caregiving behaviour (De Schipper, Marianne Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts,  2006 , Kuger & Kluczniok,  2009 ). To summarize, previous research provides some evidence that a wide age range, higher numbers of infants in the group, and a lower mean group age are all associated with lower caregiver-child interaction quality."

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,5,"fi ve years (start of mandatory kindergarten linked to the primary school). Additionally, childcare in Switzerland is characterized by a high degree of fl exibility in terms of children ’ s attendance schedules. Parents often work part-time and so choose the days of attendance depending on their individual job-related needs, which may also vary from week to week and from month to month. Thus, it is possible for individual children to attend childcare on single days (1 to 5 days a week), in the morning or afternoon, or for the whole day. The majority of children who attend childcare do so part-time for two or three days a week (Swiss Federal Statistical O ffi ce, 2014 ). The average group size is about 12 children, but a signi fi cant number of available childcare places are shared by two or more children (e.g., one child uses a childcare place on Monday morning, the other on Monday afternoon). The Swiss Childcare Association, which provides guidelines and standards on caregiving quality in childcare, takes children ’ s age and sta ff quali fi cations into account when calculating the caregiver-child ratio (Kibesuisse,  2016 ). The majority of professional caregivers in Swiss childcare have completed an apprenticeship of three years, which combines two-day school attendance and three-day in-service training per week. Caregivers trainees (i.e., young persons who attend a  fi rst year-long internship after completion of mandatory schooling) and apprentices work alongside qua- li fi ed professional caregivers (Perren et al.,  2017 , Stamm,  2009 )."

On the other hand,  fl exible childcare results in a high degree of  fl uctuation of makeup of the child- care group and permanent changes in the situational group composition (e.g., in age composition, group size and, therefore, behaviour patterns of the peer group).

As appropriate care for infants constitutes a challenge for caregivers, especially in mixed-age settings, it is necessary to account for the number of very young children present. Accordingly, we further aimed to examine peer-group age range more closely and to explore whether the e ff ects of age range can be explained by the number of children present aged under 18 months."

Rather than using a bin- ary variable, these studies looked at classroom age composition in terms of the proportion of younger children (Ansari et al., 2016), the age range between the oldest and youngest child (Moller et al., 2008), or the standard deviation of child age (Bell et al., 2013, Moller et al., 2008) in a given classroom.

During the school day, children interact with their peers through both play and educational activities and can be in fl uenced by their peers ’  skills in various ways. According to the peer- effects framework (Henry & Rickman, 2007, Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014, Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009), children may be in fl u- enced by their peers through a direct-effects path- way. For example, a child may directly learn from a peer who is more skilled in a given area. Children may also be in fl uenced by their peers ’  abilities through an indirect-effects pathway due to changes in the classroom environment that occur to accom- a child may bene fi t from more behaviorally skilled peers who are less likely to disrupt the class during learning activities (Henry & Rickman, 2007)."

A few studies have used other measures of peer skills. Henry and Rickman (2007) created a composite score of peer ability level that re fl ected the cognitive skills, prereading skills, lan- guage skills, and other basic skills of classroom peers. They found children ’ s cognitive skills, expressive lan- guage skills, and prereading skills were higher when they were in classrooms with higher peer composite skill levels.

For younger children, this higher level of peer skill experienced in mixed age classrooms is likely to have both positive direct and indirect effects on child outcomes as proposed by the peer effects framework (Henry & Rickman, 2007). Thus, peer skill may help to explain why it appears that that mixed"

To begin exploring this possibility, this study considered the question of whether classroom average peer skill accounts for the anticipated inter- action between classroom age composition and child age group. Although the effects of peers are likely more complex with the possibility that a child ’ s closest peers play a particularly important role in the child ’ s development, the present analy- ses are a  fi rst step toward better understanding the role of classroom age composition and peer skills when the two variables are jointly considered."

The Relation Between Classroom Age Composition and Children’s Language.pdf,4,"Being able to behave appropriately in the class- room also positively relates to school outcomes. Children with better behavioral skills are more equipped to meet the demands of the classroom environment, such as interacting successfully with peers and listening quietly while the teacher is talk- ing to the class. Accordingly, preschool behavioral skills have been found to relate to children ’ s adjust- ment to kindergarten, academic outcomes (Bulot- sky-Shearer & Fantuzzo, 2011, Denham et al., 2011), and peer success (Keane & Calkins, 2004)."
The Relation Between Classroom Age Composition and Children’s Language.pdf,4,"As discussed, previous research has indicated that children ’ s language and behavioral skills can be in fl uenced by both peer skill and classroom age composition (e.g., Ansari et al., 2016, Justice et al., 2011, Moller et al., 2008, Thomas et al., 2011). Due to the importance of children ’ s early language and behavioral skills for later school success, it is impor- tant to examine whether peer skill can help to explain why being in a mixed age classroom is sometimes linked to poorer outcomes for older chil- dren and better outcomes for younger children."
The Relation Between Classroom Age Composition and Children’s Language.pdf,4,"Currently, evidence is mixed regarding whether using mixed age or same age classrooms promote school readiness outcomes. In addition, to date, the level of peer skills within the classroom has not been examined as a potential mediator despite logical argu- ments that peer skills for older preschoolers will be higher in same age classrooms than in mixed age class- rooms and for younger preschoolers will be higher in mixed age classrooms than in same age classrooms. This study aims to address this issue by considering peers ’  language and behavioral skills when examining whether mixed age or same age classrooms promote skills for older or younger preschoolers."
The Relation Between Classroom Age Composition and Children’s Language.pdf,4,"To accomplish these goals, this study used data from the Educare Implementation Study. Children receive early childhood education through Head Start in Educare programs at 23 schools across the United States (for a summary of sites see Educare Learning Network, 2016). Since all Educare sites participate in the Educare Implementation Study and children are evaluated annually, there are data available on a large sample of children from multi- ple classrooms. These data were used to explore this study ’ s three hypotheses: (a) Child age will moderate how classroom age composition relates to child outcomes, with younger children showing higher levels of skills in mixed age than in same age classrooms and older children showing higher levels of skills in same age than in mixed age"

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,1,"Social interaction and task behavior of preschool children in mixed-age (MA) and same-age (SA) groups were studied longitudinally in this natural experiment, which capitalized on one preschool’s transition from two SA (separate 3, 4) classrooms to two MA (combined 3/4) classrooms. In contrast to previous research examining MA and SA grouping, which has typically lacked appropriate comparison groups, the present study was essentially able to hold teachers, curriculum, location, teaching philosophy, and participant population constant. A total of 7887 naturalistic, time-sampled, classroom observations on 47 children attending the two classes were conducted over the course of 18 months. Children’s goal-directed activity, sustained attention, social affiliation, inappropriate behavior, and affect were reliably recorded using a checklist instrument. Significant age differences in behavior between the 3- and 4-year-olds in SA classrooms were typically eliminated in the context of MA classrooms such that the 3-year-olds in MA classes in several ways were more like 4-year-olds in SA classrooms, and 4-year-olds in MA classes behaved more like 3-year-olds in SA classrooms. The social and behavioral ecology of the MA preschool classrooms changed significantly over time as children became more familiar with one another. Several of the social affiliation advantages of MA grouping that were found (i.e., age and gender desegregation) wore off over time as the school year progressed. The effects of MA grouping on children’s social and behavioral development appear complicated. Developmental"

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"Understanding similarities and differences between mixed-age (MA) and same-age (SA) peer interactions among young children is a worthwhile endeavor for both theoretical and practical reasons. In terms of theory, both Vygotsky’s and Piaget’s works suggest differential effects on children’s cognitive and social development for asymmetric (MA) as opposed to symmetric (SA) peer interactions (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliam, 1993, Hartup, 1983, Piaget, 1932, Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 1998, Vygotsky, 1930/1978). Interaction with SA peers (who are more likely to be equal in terms of knowledge, skill, and power) is thought to provide a unique context for children to engage in and resolve cognitive conflicts with others, thereby stimulating cognitive, social, and moral development (Azmitia, 1988, Piaget, 1932, Tudge, 1992). Interaction with older, more competent children is seen as an optimal context for facilitating cognitive and behavioral development according to Vygotskian and social learning/cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, Hartup, 1983, Vygotsky 1930–1935/1978). Interaction with younger children is thought to afford older children an opportunity to practice and develop prosocial, self-regulatory, and leadership skills (French, Waas, Stright, & Baker, 1986, Hartup, 1983, Katz, Evangelou, & Hartman, 1990, Messer, Joiner, Loveridge, Light, & Littleton, 1993, Winsler & Diaz, 1995), and, for older socially withdrawn children, an opportunity to facilitate social participation and social skills (Furman, Rahe, & Hartup, 1979, Hartup, 1983). It is important to note in this connection, however, that most of the research exploring the effects of age composition on children’s peer interactions has been conducted in laboratory or quasi-laboratory settings (e.g., placing children of various ages or ability levels together in the same room with a task and observing what happens). Less understood are the dynamics of SA and MA peer interactions that occur in naturalistic settings such as the early childhood classroom. childhood education (Katz et al., 1990, Lloyd, 1999). Advocates of MA grouping in early education claim that the MA classroom holds many social and cognitive advantages over SA classrooms by creating a richer and more diverse educational environment, minimizing normative pressures and competition, encouraging prosocial behavior, self-regulation, and social responsibility, increasing children’s tolerance for diversity, and decreasing gender segregation (Derscheid, 1997, Elkind, 1989, Goldman, 1981, Katz et al., 1990, Pratt, 1986, Roberts, Burchinal, & Bailey, 1994, Theilheimer, 1993, Whaley & Kantor, 1992). In MA groupings, because a wider range of child competencies is expected in the first place, the teacher is seen as better able to notice and respond to individual differences in children and provide for a more diverse and individually tailored set of experiences than is the case within"
