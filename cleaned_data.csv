Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,2,"Most of us, and even most of our parents and grandparents, grew up in an age-segregated school system, which makes contemporary school systems seem natural and universal. Children are organized by ages into grades and proceed through a school system of sequential grade levels and curricula. According to Stone and Burriss ( 2019 ), age-segre- gation schooling is founded on a factory model and is a product of the Industrial Revolu- tion that has permeated the world for 200 years. Learning is seen as a sequence of discrete skills that became more complex from year to year, and children of the same age are assumed to be the same in terms of development and needs. Children, at least children in US public schools, typically go outside for recess breaks to play with same-age peers in the same class and often do not have opportunities at school to play with children from other grades.",most even parent grandpar grew age segreg school system make contemporari seem natur univers child organ grade proceed sequenti level curriculum accord stone burriss 2019 segre- gation found factori model product industri revolu- tion permeat world 200 year learn seen sequenc discret skill becam more complex assum term develop need least public typic go outsid recess break play peer class often not opportun

Advantages of mixed-age free play in elementary.pdf,3,"Mixed-age grouping, also known as multiage grouping, heterogeneous grouping, ver- tical grouping, family grouping, and ungraded classes, is the practice of placing children who are at least a year apart in age into the same group or class (Katz, Evangelou, & Hartman,  1990 , Pool, Bijleveld, & Tavecchio,  2000 ). Unlike the factory model, such grouping assumes that children vary in development and needs in ways not fully predict- able by age and that children can learn from those who are older and younger. Mixed- aged classrooms have been shown to be effective, as older children have opportunities to be leaders and teachers (Montessori,  1979 ), younger children can bene fi t from the modeling of older children (Kappler & Roellke,  2002 ), and teachers are able to provide di ff erentiated, developmentally-appropriate curriculum to the range of students (Kappler & Roellke,  2002 , Lloyd,  1999 ).

In mixed-age unstructured play groupings older children often operate within the younger child ’ s zone of proximal development (ZPD). Sca ff olding occurs in mixed-age play as a way of supporting younger children to a level that makes games enjoyable and older children often do not provide more help than the younger children wants or needs (Gray,  2013 ).

Golden Key principles include mixed age play, family involvement, meaningful lessons or events, di ff erentiated lessons for younger and older children, and pairing two teachers to ask children ques- tions. Integration of Vygotskian principles and the Golden Key principles of mixed- age play and enhanced home-school links resulted in improvements in children ’ s learn- ing and social interactions. Teachers reported improved social interactions of children ‘ that implied trust, care, and respect ’  (p.142).

They found that two-year-olds in mixed-aged pairs engage in more complex play. Findings demonstrated that  fi ve-year-olds played at the same advanced level when paired with two-year-olds, drawing the toddlers into their play by providing them with appropriate props and telling them how to use the props. These younger children engaged in cooperative, social, and pretend play with  fi ve- year-olds, beyond their capabilities with their own peers. Goldman ( 1981 ) found that both 3-and-4-year-olds in mixed-age preschools engaged in less parallel play as com- pared to associative or cooperative forms of play, relative to those children in same age classrooms.

A handful of researchers (Byrnes et al.,  1994 , Edwards et al.,  2009 , McClellan & Kinsey,  1999 ) have assessed parent, teacher, and children ’ s perceptions of mixed-age play in the context of classrooms, not outdoor play.",sum accord vygotski 1978 develop occur most rapidli when chil- dren collabor child appear bene fi mix age group play context well classroom toddler preschool school empir studi suggest possibl cost older gray 2013 extens qualit data interact adolesc 12 19 11 seem demonstr advantag go direct p. 197 parent often concern safeti 2011 skenazi 2010 while teacher see riski outdoor button wild 2019 pauciti research relat recess let grow club hand byrn et al 1994 edward 2009 mcclellan kinsey 1999 assess percept not

However,   there   is   little understanding   of   the mech-   anisms that   link age   composition   to   children’s   development.   In   this study,   we   examined the   extent   to   which classroom   age composition   shaped children’s   classroom engagement,   as   well   as   the mediating   role   of   classroom engagement   in   the links   between classroom   age composition   and children’s   language and   literacy gains.   The data   were drawn   from the   Teacher Professional   Development Study,   a   study   of   895   4-year-olds across   223 classrooms.   We   found that   positive engagement   with teachers   mediated associ-   ations between   classroom age   composition and   children’s   vocabulary gains.   Specifically,   4-year-olds   in   classrooms with   a   greater number   of   younger classmates   experienced less   positive engagement   with their   teachers,   which   in   turn,   contributed   to   smaller vocabulary   gains across   the year.   In   addition,   being with   a   greater number   of   older classmates   was associated   with lower   negative engagement   in   the classroom.

These early   language and   liter-   acy skills   are critical   for children’s   short-   and long-term school   success   (   McLaughlin,   Speirs,   &   Shenassa,   2014   ,   Whitehurst   &   Loni-   gan,   1998   ).

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,1,"Despite the   importance   of   classroom engagement   for children’s   overall classroom   experience,   little   is   known about   what predicts   preschoolers’   engagement.   From   a   developmental-ecological per-   spective,   one possible   driver   at   the classroom   level   is   the age   com-   position   of   children   in   the classroom.   Classroom age   composition   imposes different   demands   on   teachers’   provisions   of   instruction   and activities,   and shapes   with whom   children interact   in   peer   play.   These factors   may influence   children’s   interpersonal dynam-   ics with   teachers and   peers,   as   well   as   their physical   interactions   with tasks.   Therefore,   this study   incorporates factors   across the   classroom-   and child-level and   seeks   to   examine the   extent   to   which:   (a)   classroom age   composition   is   associated with   4-year-   olds’   classroom engagement,   and   (b)   children’s   classroom engage-   ment mediates   associations between   classroom age   composition   and their   language and   literacy growth.

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"their early   learning and   development   (   Paro,   M.,   Pianta,   &   Stuhlman,   2004   ,   2012   ,   Sabol,   Hong,   S.,   Pianta,   &   Burchinal,   2013   ).   To   date,   however,   much   of   the focus   has been   on   the overall   structural and   process quality   of   classrooms   (e.g.,   CLASS and   ECERS,   Early,   Sideris,   Neitzel,   LaForett   &   Nehler,   2018   ,   Pianta,   La   Paro   &   Hamre,   2008   ),   which tend   to   show only   weak   to   moderate associations   with chil-   dren’s   skills gains   (   Burchinal,   2018   ).   These patterns   of   weak   to   moderate associations   are perhaps   not surprising   because individ-   ual children   experience the   classroom differently.   Put another   way,   the degree   to   which children   benefit from   high quality   classrooms   is,   at   least   in   part,   driven   by   how they   engage with   the classroom   setting   (   Howes,   20   0   0   ).   In   support   of   these assertions,   an   emerging   body   of   research suggests   that children’s   individual experiences,   including the   amount and   type   of   teacher instruction   and inter-   actions with   teachers,   vary greatly   among children   in   the same   classroom   (   Connor   et   al.,   2009   ,   Pelatti,   Piasta,   Justice,   &   O’Connell,   2014   ,   Sawyer   et   al.,   2018   ).   For example,   Connor   et   al.   (2009)   found   that the   amount   of   small-group literacy   instruction observed   for   individual children   in   a   first-grade classroom   within   a   2-hour block   ranged from   23   minutes   to   43   minutes.   The amount   of   variance   in   children’s   individual classroom   experience may   be   especially large   in   preschool given   that preschoolers   spend   a   significant amount   of   example,   Vitiello,   Booren,   Downer and   Williford   (2012)   found that   7%–23%   of   the variance   in   preschoolers’   classroom experiences   was   attributable   to   differences between   children,   which was   compara-   ble   to   the variance   at   the classroom   level   (i.e.,   3%–22%).

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,2,"According   to   Piaget   (1983)   and Vygotsky   (1978)   ,   children’s   de-   velopment   is   embedded   in   their social   interactions with   their   teacher and   peers   in   conjunction with   their physical   interac-   tions with   objects,   which are   the main   resources and   mechanisms   through which   children achieve   higher-level skills.   Importantly,   the   ways   in   which children   engage with   their teachers,   peers,   and   tasks can   be   either both   positive   or   negative   (   McEvoy,   Estrem,   Rodriguez,   &   Olson,   2003   ).   As   such,   prior studies   have concep-   tualized children’s   classroom engagement   as   4   distinct constructs   (   Bohlmann   &   Downer,   2016   ,   Sabol   et   al.,   2018   ).   The first   dimen-   sion,   positive engagement   with teachers,   captures children’s   emo-   tional connection   and communication   with their   teacher,   such   as   the degree   to   which children   seek proximity   to   their teachers.   The second   dimension,   positive engagement   with peers,   refers   to   children’s   initiation and   maintenance   of   positive interactions   with   classmates,   including their   successful initiation   of   conversation and   play.   The third   dimension,   positive engagement   with tasks,   taps   into the   degree   to   which children   orient themselves   toward class-   room activities,   such   as   remaining focused   on   an   activity for   an   extended period.   Finally,   the fourth   and final   dimension,   negative   classroom engagement,   includes children’s   conflict with   teachers   and peers   and their   display   of   off-task and   dysregulated behaviors   (   Downer   et   al.,   2010   ).

For example,   children who   engage more   pos-   itively with   their teachers   and peers   have been   found   to   have   more positive   relationships and   experience more   dyadic conversa-   tions,   richer language   use,   and more   individualized learning   than   children who   engage with   their teacher   and peers   less positively   (   Hartz,   Williford,   &   Koomen,   2017   ,   Justice,   McGinty,   Zucker,   Ca-   bell,   &   Piasta,   2013   ).   These outcomes   are key   for children’s   lan-   guage and   literacy learning   (   Cabell,   Justice,   McGinty,   DeCoster,   &   Forston,   2015   ,   Sabol   et   al.,   2018   ).

In   this study,   we   examine the   role   of   classroom age   composition and   opera-   tionalize   it   as   the proportion   of   children   in   different age   groups   at   the classroom   level.   We   focus   on   this aspect   of   the class-   room setting   as   a   predictor   of   children’s   engagement for   2   rea-   sons.   First,   unlike   K-12,   preschool classrooms   often serve   chil-   dren   of   multiple age   groups.   According   to   the national   statistics,   47   states allow   preschool programs   to   have mixed-age group-   ings,   and roughly   75%   of   Head Start   classrooms are   mixed-age   (   Moiduddin,   Aikens,   Tarullo,   West,   &   Xue,   2012   ,   National Center   on   Child Care   Quality Improvement   &   National Association   for   Regulatory Administration,   2015   ).   These states   provide varied   re-   quirements about   the expected   number   of   children   in   each age   group and   teacher-child ratios,   which may   contribute   to   hetero-   geneity   in   the distribution   of   children   in   different age   groups doc-   recent work   has shown   that the   mixture   of   ages within   preschool   classrooms has   implications for   both teachers’   classroom prac-   tices and   children’s   early learning   (   Ansari   et   al.,   2016   ,   Bell,   Green-   field,   &   Bulotsky-Shearer,   2013   ,   Moller,   Forbes-Jones   &   Hightower,   gan,   2019   ).   For example,   4-year-olds who   were enrolled   in   class-   rooms with   more   3-year-olds demonstrated   smaller gains   in   aca-   demic skills   (   Ansari   et   al.,   2016   ).   Notwithstanding the   widespread   use   of   mixed-age classrooms   and its   connection with   children’s   early learning,   we   know little   about what   is   needed   to   ensure that   mixed-age classrooms   successfully meet   the needs   of   all children.   Thus,   this study   aimed   to   fill this   knowledge gap   by   examining   children’s   classroom engagement   as   a   potential mechanism.

These challenges   expe-   rienced   by   teachers may,   in   part,   be   due   to   younger children   hav-   ing relatively   lower skills   on   average,   which results   in   the exposure   to   less effective   instruction for   older children   in   the same   class-   room   (   Wilkinson   &   Fung,   2002   ,   Yeomans-Maldonado   et   al.,   2019   ).   In   particular,   this may   reduce exposure   to   richness and   variabil-   ity   in   vocabulary and   syntactic structure   (   Huttenlocher,   Vasilyeva,   Cymerman,   &   Levine,   2002   ).   Furthermore,   studies examining   inter-   actional quality   conclude that   teachers who   teach younger   children   or   teach   in   more age-diverse settings   display lower-quality interac-   tions   (   Ansari   &   Pianta,   2019   ,   Kuger,   Kluczniok,   Kaplan,   &   Rossbach,   2016   )   but engage   in   more positive   interactions with   older and   better-behaved children   (   Vitiello   et   al.,   2012   ).

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"Classroom age   composition may   also explain   variation   in   chil-   dren’s   engagement with   peers.   Developmental studies   have long   shown that   the level   of   children’s   language and   literacy abilities,   as   well   as   social-emotional skills,   largely depend   on   children’s   age   (   Skibbe,   Montroy,   Bowles,   &   Morrison,   2019   ).   As   such,   children   en-   rolled   in   classrooms with   a   higher percentage   of   older children   are   more likely   to   have interactions   with peers   who have   higher lev-   els   of   language skills   and greater   peer language   resources   (   Henry   &   Rickman,   2007   ),   which   in   turn,   contributes   to   more positive   en-   gagement with   peers.

Classroom age composition and preschoolers’ language and literacy gains The role of classroom engagement.pdf,3,"Classroom age   composition may   also influence   children’s   en-   gagement with   tasks.   As   illustrated earlier,   the average   age and   skills   of   children   in   the classroom   may shape   teachers’   provision   of   tasks and   instructional support   (   Yeomans-Maldonado   et   al.,   2019   ),   which may   further influence   how well   children maintain   focus and   engage   in   self-directed learning   (   Strati,   Schmidt,   &   Maier,   2017   ).   Both the   provision   of   developmentally age-appropriate tasks   and   quality instructional   support   in   the classroom   are likely   to   fos-   ter children’s   engagement with   classroom tasks.   However,   a   larger   range   of   ages   in   the classroom   poses challenges   for teachers   to   pro-   vide individualized   tasks and   instructional support   (   Ansari,   2017   ).   Ansari   (2021)   showed that   teachers   in   mixed-age classrooms   serv-   ing   a   larger number   of   younger children   provided fewer   writing   materials and   books   on   average.   In   addition,   the above-mentioned   interpersonal dynamics   with teachers   and peers   resulting from   classroom age   composition may   also ensure   emotional security   that allows   children   to   better engage   in   tasks   (   Alamos   &   Willi-   ford,   2020   ).   Hence,   we   postulate that   children   in   classrooms with   more older   peers may   display more   positive engagement   with   tasks   as   compared with   children   in   classrooms with   more younger   peers.",classroom age composit may also influenc child ’s en- gagement task illustr earlier averag skill shape teacher provis instruct support yeoman maldonado et al 2019 well maintain focu engag self direct learn schmidt maier 2017 development appropri qualiti like fos- ter howev larger rang pose challeng pro- vide individu ansari 2021 show mix serv- ing number younger provid fewer write materi book addit mention interperson dynam peer result ensur emot secur allow better alamo willi- ford 2020 henc postul more older display posit compar

Earlier studies   comparing the   incidence   of   peer conflict   among different   age groups   indicate less   frequent   peer conflict   and more   child-generated resolution   occurring among   older age   groups   (   Chen,   Fein,   Killen,   &   Tam,   2001   ,   Raikes,   Virmani,   Thompson   &   Hatton,   2013   ).

Studies   have documented   that classroom   age composition,   as   measured   by   the proportion   of   younger classmates   or   variability/range   of   chil-   dren’s   age   in   the classroom,   are associated   with children’s   lan-   guage and   literacy development   (   Ansari   et   al.,   2016   ,   Justice,   Lo-   ample,   Ansari   et   al.

Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,1,"Whether implemented for pedagogical or logistical rea- sons, mixed-age classrooms have a long history in preschool,  and much of the initial support for this educational model  comes from Vygotskian theory, which posits that children  learn from their peers (Vygotsky, 1978). Indeed, mixed-age  age classrooms provide younger children the opportunity to  model behaviors their older peers exhibit and provide older  students with opportunities to scaffold and teach their  younger classmates (Lillard, 2016, Winsler et  al., 2002).  Mixed-age classrooms also provide students with a greater  range of interactions, which is often argued to facilitate the  development of a wide range of social skills, including  empathy and self-regulation (Lillard, 2016). However,  recent studies do not support the notion that mixed-age  classrooms are beneficial for older children (Ansari et al.,  2016, Moller et al., 2008). These documented negative asso- ciations between mixed-age classrooms and the learning of  the older students in the classroom may in part be due to the  additional challenges teachers may encounter when working  with children of greater age diversity.

Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"To explore these questions, we use a bioecological lens  (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006) and focus on interactions  between children and their proximal classroom context.  From this, we propose that children’s academic and social- behavioral development in the preschool years is shaped by  both features of their preschool context and their own indi- vidual characteristics. Specifically, we focus on interactions  between two contextual characteristics of the classroom: the  ages of one’s classmates and the observed quality of the  classroom and teacher (as defined by their qualifications).  Importantly, we hypothesize that the influence of these inter- actions varies by children’s own age, which is recognized as  a “person” characteristic (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006)  or a referent status in other peer effects research (Justice,  Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn, 2011). For example,  a 3-year-old may be positively influenced by the presence of  older, more skilled peers regardless of the quality of the  classroom they are in, whereas a 4-year-old may need par- ticular contextual supports to demonstrate academic growth  when in a classroom with younger peers.

Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"One possibility is that the influence of mixed-age class- rooms and children’s early learning and development  depends on the quality of the classroom environment. To  begin, there is substantial evidence that suggests that the  classroom quality is an important feature of early child- hood programs (Keys et al., 2013, Mashburn et al., 2008).  In general, classroom quality focuses on two domains:  structural quality and process quality. Current research  suggests that structural quality, which includes factors such  as leadership within the preschool, teacher qualifications,  and child-adult ratios, is necessary but not enough to pro- duce optimal environments for children to learn and  develop in (Burchinal, 2017).",one possibl influenc mix age class- room child ’s earli learn develop depend qualiti classroom environ begin substanti evid suggest import featur child- hood program key et al 2013 mashburn 2008 gener focu two domain structur process current research includ factor leadership within preschool teacher qualif adult ratio necessari not enough pro- duce optim 2017

Because process quality captures the experiential  aspect of preschool, including the instruction a child receives  and the supportiveness of their teacher, it may modify the  associations between age composition and children’s learn- ing and development. Specifically, higher quality teacher- child interactions may be indicative of classrooms that are  more effectively meeting the needs of young children of dif- ferent ages (e.g., scaffolding, individual time), whereas  lower quality classrooms may be indicative of teachers who  are struggling. Thus, higher quality classrooms may alter  children’s classrooms experiences in mixed-age classrooms,  such as their interactions with their teachers and peers,  which prior studies suggest has implications for children’s  school success (Henry & Rickman, 2007, Howes et  al.,  2008, Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014, Mashburn,  Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009).",qualiti more strongli associ child ’s gain languag literaci social develop compar numer indic structur howe et al 2008 process captur experienti aspect preschool includ instruct receiv support teacher may modifi age composit learn- ing specif higher teacher- interact classroom effect meet need young dif- ferent e.g. scaffold individu time wherea lower struggl thu alter experi mix peer prior studi suggest implic school success henri rickman 2007 justic lin kaderavek 2014 mashburn downer pianta 2009
Classroom Age Composition and Preschoolers’ School Readiness the implications of classroom quality and teachers qualifications.pdf,2,"In support of these notions, an exploratory study by  Guo, Tompkins, Justice, and Petscher (2014) found that  mixed-age preschool programs can be beneficial when  coupled with high-quality teacher-child interactions. In  this study, vocabulary development among 130 preschool  children in 16 classrooms was examined. Children in class- rooms with wider age variance demonstrated larger gains  in vocabulary across the year. This association was stron- ger for the younger children in the classroom and notably,  was stronger when the classroom was of higher quality.  Presumably, children in high-quality classrooms have more  opportunities to have meaningful interactions with their  teacher and peers, both of which may enhance the experi- ence of being in a mixed-age environment. The quality of  the classroom may thus change the effects of age composi- tion, although it has rarely been examined in this context.  However, other related work from Tulsa’s pre-K programs  has revealed that there is a large degree of variation in  pre-K impacts more generally as a function of classroom  instructional quality (Johnson, Markowitz, Hill, & Phillips,  2016), which supports the general notions discussed  previously.",support notion exploratori studi guo tompkin justic petscher 2014 found mix age preschool program can benefici when coupl high qualiti teacher child interact vocabulari develop among 130 16 classroom examin class- room wider varianc demonstr larger gain across year associ stron- ger younger notabl stronger higher presum more opportun meaning peer may enhanc experi- enc environ thu chang effect composi- tion although rare context howev relat work ’s pre reveal larg degre variat impact gener function instruct johnson markowitz hill phillip 2016 discuss previous

Variations in these types of activities as well as  other teacher-influenced classroom attributes, such as the  amount of instructional time, may change the way age com- position influences children’s development.

Furthermore, it may be that the skills gained through prior  education and experience provide a specific boost for teach- ers in mixed-age classrooms. These teachers may have more  specific strategies, not captured in global quality measures,  that enable them to promote development among all children  in the classroom such as ways to assign roles in group work  that maximize the potential learning opportunities for chil- dren of different ages.

For example, teachers’ ability to differen- tiate their instruction to match student needs is an important  aspect of children’s classroom experiences, but many teach- ers do not feel confident about their ability to do so effec- tively (Manship, Farber, Smith, & Drummond, 2016). The  importance of differentiation may be magnified in mixed- age classrooms as children’s skills are likely to be more vari- able than in same-age classrooms. Accordingly, we  hypothesize that teachers’ education and experience may  change children’s experiences in mixed-age preschool set- tings because they may capture the degree to which teachers  are more comfortable with specific practices, such as effec- tive differentiation, that are especially necessary in the con- text of classrooms that are more age diverse.",particular number aspect teach not well captur current measur qualiti may particularli import mix age context 2017 exampl teacher abil differen- tiat instruct match student need child ’s classroom experi mani teach- er feel confid effec- tive manship farber smith drummond 2016 differenti magnifi mixed- skill like more vari- abl than accordingli hypothes educ chang preschool set- ting degre comfort specif practic especi necessari con- text divers

We also hypothesized that benefits  may emerge for 3-year-olds in mixed-age classrooms when  classrooms were of high quality as this may provide an  opportunity for high-quality interactions with older and  more skilled peers.

However, 4-year-olds who entered school with low inhibitory control and print knowledge demonstrated greater gains in both domains when attending classrooms with more same-age or older classmates than when in class- rooms with more younger peers.

This expansion of pre- school stems from the fact that these programs not only facilitate children ’ s school preparedness, but have also been found to narrow developmental disparities throughout the life course (Sorensen & Dodge,  2015 , Vandell, Burchinal, & Pierce,  2016 ). With the promise of preschool coupled with its continued expansion, there has been growing interest in understanding the drivers of how these programs impact children (Duncan & Magnuson,  2013 ). One such aspect of among both researchers and policymakers is age compos- ition, in large part because programs often regulate access by age. Notwithstanding these regulations, as preschool expands and Head Start and state prekindergarten (preK) funds are more often used to serve children in common classrooms (i.e., the blending/braiding of local, state, and federal funds), an increasing number of 3-years-olds are being served in classrooms with 4-year-olds, making class- rooms that enroll different age children a more prevalent experience for preschoolers across the country (Ansari, Education,  2012 ).",respect depart educ 2015 expans pre- school stem fact program not facilit child prepared also found narrow development dispar throughout life cours sorensen dodg vandel burchin pierc 2016 promis preschool coupl continu grow interest understand driver impact duncan magnuson 2013 one aspect among research policymak age compos- ition larg part often regul access notwithstand expand head start state prekindergarten prek fund more use serv common classroom i.e. blend braid local feder increas number year old make class- room enrol differ preval experi across countri ansari 2012

Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"theories of social learning (Bandura,  1986 ) and cognitive development (Vygotsky,  1978 ) also guide our investigation, as they both contend that interactions between children and their peers (i.e., peer effects) can be one of the primary mechanisms through which classroom experience affects students ’  development. For example, these theories suggest that, in a classroom ecology, higher-skilled (or older) chil- dren can  directly promote the early learning and develop- ment of their lower-skilled (or younger) peers and, in so child-by-child transmission). In support of these theoretical arguments laid out by Bandura ( 1986 ) and Vygotsky ( 1978 ), a number of studies have found that children ’ s classmates do shape their individual development (Henry & Rickman, 2007 , Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek,  2014 , Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta,  2009 , Yudron, Jones, & Raver, 2014 ). At the same time, however, other developmental and educational scholars suggest that there is considerable more nuance to the peer ecology and that careful attention should be paid to the individual characteristics of children and their families (e.g., Ribeiro, Zachrisson, & Dearing,  2017 ) and the ways in which the peer ecology intersects with various other aspects of the classroom environment (e.g., Guo, Tompkins,",theori social learn bandura 1986 cognit develop vygotski 1978 also guid investig contend interact child peer i.e. effect can one primari mechan classroom experi affect student exampl suggest ecolog higher skill older chil- dren directli promot earli develop- ment lower younger transmiss support theoret argument laid number studi found classmat shape individu henri rickman 2007 justic lin kaderavek 2014 mashburn downer pianta 2009 raver time howev development educ scholar consider more nuanc care attent should paid characterist famili e.g. ribeiro dear 2017 way intersect variou aspect environ guo tompkin
Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,3,"Although less often discussed, it is also plausible that the age composition of the classroom affects children through indirect means, such as effects on teacher-child interactions (i.e., child-to-teacher-to-child transmission, Ansari & Pianta, 2018 , Snell, Hindman, & Belsky,  2015 ). Indeed, teachers in classrooms with greater age heterogeneity (e.g., 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds) are faced with challenges that include adjusting instruction to a wider range of skill levels relative to class- rooms that have a more uniform age level (e.g., only 4-year- olds), and at the upper and lower ends of the age distribu- tion this could impact children if teachers cannot address this demand. Accordingly, theories of the peer ecology of effects on children ’ s early school performance and may shape one of the primary pathways through which preschool programs impact children (see also, Henry & Rickman, 2007 , Justice et al.,  2014 , Mashburn et al.,  2009 , Yudron et al.,  2014 ).

The nega- tive associations between age heterogeneity and child devel- opment were strongest for the oldest children in the classroom. Second, a recent nationally representative study of classrooms in Head Start revealed that 4-year-olds dis- played fewer gains in areas of early mathematics and lan- guage and literacy when they attended classrooms with a greater number of 3-year-olds (Ansari et al.,  2016 ), with effect sizes in some classrooms corresponding to approxi- mately 4 – 5 months of development. Both studies also docu- mented no consistent benefits of having older classmates for the school performance of the youngest children in the classroom (Ansari et al.,  2016 , Moller et al.,  2008 ), suggest- ing that careful attention must be paid to the older children in these environments.

In light of the literature and theoretical arguments underpinning peer effects and child development more generally (e.g., Bandura,  1986 , Vygotsky,  1978 ), a more complete assessment of the implica- tions of age composition for children ’ s early learning is likely necessary.

Classroom age composition and the early learning of preschoolers.pdf,4,"Given the conflicting claims related to classroom age composition effects, a number of studies have also empha- sized the role of children ’ s incoming skill levels, both as a potential moderator of classroom effects and as a means of disentangling the different ways in which classroom com- positional factors shape children ’ s early learning (for a related discussion, see Justice, Petscher, Schatschneider, & Mashburn,  2011 , Mashburn et al.,  2009 ). Children ’ s own to understand the implications of classroom age composition because children ’ s skills and behaviors shape the ways in which children interact with their peers and teachers, and in turn, have implications for the ways in which classrooms impact children. In the context of mixed-aged classrooms, of particular importance are (a) children ’ s language/literacy skills, which enable them to communicate with their peers and teachers, and (b) their executive functioning, which allows children to manage their behavior and emotions (Duncan et al.,  2007 , Mashburn et al.,  2009 , Masten et al., 2012 , McClelland et al.,  2013 ). And in support of these very points, a number of studies have found that although lower- skilled children do learn more from their interactions with their older and more skilled peers, higher-skilled children are neither harmed by nor consistently benefit from their interactions with their classmates (Guo et al.,  2014 , Justice et al.,  2011 ).",given conflict claim relat classroom age composit effect number studi also empha- size role child incom skill level potenti moder mean disentangl differ way com- posit factor shape earli learn discuss see justic petscher schatschneid mashburn 2011 et 2009 understand implic behavior interact peer teacher turn impact context mix particular import languag literaci enabl commun execut function allow manag emot duncan al 2007 masten 2012 mcclelland 2013 support point found although lower- more older higher neither harm nor consist benefit classmat guo 2014

Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"These cognitive and social-learning theories underlie  the peer-effects framework (Henry & Rickman, 2007,  Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014, Mashburn, Justice,  Downer, & Pianta, 2009) that guides this study. In con- trast to the evidence on the effects of teachers on chil- dren, however, the literature on peer effects—and how  children’s learning is directly affected by their class- mates—is far shallower, especially during the preschool  years. Understanding the role of peer effects during this  period is critical because much of the classroom instruc- tion in early care and education programs occurs through  peer interactions and whole-group activities as opposed  to teacher-directed instruction (Ansari & Gershoff, 2015,  Mashburn et al., 2009). The omission of peer effects from  past evaluations of Head Start has left a critical gap in  knowledge. In fact, classroom age composition may be  one of the main reasons why the Head Start program has  been documented as less effective for older children than  for younger children (Jenkins, Farkas, Duncan, Burchinal,  & Vandell, 2015, Puma et al., 2010), although this possi- bility has yet to be tested.",cognit social learn theori underli peer effect framework henri rickman 2007 justic lin kaderavek 2014 mashburn downer pianta 2009 guid studi con- trast evid teacher chil- dren howev literatur child ’s directli affect class- mate far shallow especi preschool year understand role period critic much classroom instruc- tion earli care educ program occur interact whole group activ oppos direct instruct ansari gershoff 2015 et al omiss past evalu head start left gap knowledg fact age composit may one main reason document less older than younger jenkin farka duncan burchin vandel puma 2010 although possi- biliti yet test
Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"Prior research has suggested two primary reasons that  peer effects may be important in early childhood class- rooms. One is the direct-effects pathway (Justice et al.,  2014, Mashburn et al., 2009). In this pathway, children  are directly influenced by their peer’s abilities. From this  perspective, one would hypothesize that mixed-age  classrooms would be beneficial for younger children but  may be deleterious for the skill development of older  children. The second is an indirect-effects pathway,  whereby teachers modify their classroom practices to  accommodate a wide range of skill levels, which can lead  to less challenging content and potential disengagement  for older children (Urberg & Kaplan, 1986). This pathway  is particularly salient when considering children’s behav- ior, as having a wide range of behaviors in the classroom  or a high concentration of problem behaviors is challeng- ing for teachers to manage (Yudron, Jones, & Raver,  2014), therefore, teachers of mixed-age classrooms may  spend more time on classroom management than on  activities that facilitate children’s learning. While both of  these pathways for peer effects seem feasible, the evi- dence regarding mixed-age preschool classrooms has  been ambiguous, with some studies documenting posi- tive effects (Blasco, Bailey, & Burchinal, 1993, Goldman,  1981, Guo, Tompkins, Justice, & Petscher, 2014), and oth- ers documenting null or negative associations (Bell,  Greenfield, & Bulotsky-Shearer, 2013, Moller, Forbes- Jones, & Hightower, 2008, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986, Winsler  et al., 2002).

Classroom Age Composition and the schoolreadiness.pdf,2,"Recent studies that have tried to address these out- standing issues have been limited in a few notable ways.  First, these studies have not examined these processes  using a national data set, and, therefore, some of the con- flicting evidence may be the result of prior studies having  generally used small and localized samples (Blasco et al.,  1993, Goldman, 1981, Guo et  al., 2014, Winsler et  al.,  2002). Second, although two studies (Bell et  al., 2013,  Moller et al., 2008) provided much needed—albeit con- flicting—evidence on the potential outcomes of mixed- age classrooms for low-income children, they relied on  teachers’ reports of children’s academic skills.

Third, researchers have usu- ally failed to control for other classroom processes and  selection factors, thus limiting their ability to draw firm  conclusions about class composition. Finally, although  restricted-age classrooms may be more effective than  mixed-age classrooms (Moller et  al., 2008), it may not  always be feasible to separately serve 3- and 4-year-olds  in all areas of the country (Veenman, 1995), in other  words, mixed-age classrooms are sometimes created out  of necessity. Thus, an additional scientific and policy  question that remains to be answered is whether there is  a threshold or tipping point at which the ratio of younger  to older students in mixed-age classrooms has a more  deleterious or positive effect for children.",recent studi tri address out- stand issu limit few notabl way first not examin process use nation data set therefor some con- flict evid may result prior gener small local sampl blasco et al 1993 goldman 1981 guo 2014 winsler 2002 second although two bell 2013 moller 2008 provid much need albeit potenti outcom mixed- age classroom low incom child reli teacher report ’s academ skill problemat like bias reflect percept abil rel classmat mashburn 2009 particularli cohort third research usu- alli fail control select factor thu draw firm conclus class composit final restrict more effect than mix alway feasibl separ serv 3- year old all area countri veenman 1995 word sometim creat necess addit scientif polici question remain answer whether threshold tip point ratio younger older student deleteri posit

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"Not surprisingly, considerable attention has focused on ways to facilitate the early vocabulary development of preschool children from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds in order to mitigate the well-documented achievement gap in the area of vocabulary (e.g., Neuman & Celano, 2001, Tabors, 1997, Wasik et al., 2006, Weizman & Snow, 2001, Wells, 1986). For instance, recent research has focused on the role that young children’s peers may play in facil- itating vocabulary development (e.g., Henry & Rickman, 2007, Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009). These investigations of peer effects within preschool classrooms show that the language skills of children’s classmates are a significant and unique predictor of language growth, even beyond effects attributable to instructional quality (Mashburn et al., 2009). Specifi- cally, higher peer language skills were positively related to children’s language outcomes during prekindergarten, indicating that children may benefit from being in a classroom that, in the aggregate, contains older, more cognitively advanced children and that this is particularly true for children with lower language skills. Such findings suggest that classroom age composition may be an important consideration in understanding factors that influence children’s vocabulary development within early education settings, as it provides information about peer characteristics in the classroom. For instance, if children’s vocabulary growth is facilitated through their interactions with peers, it may be important for younger children (e.g., 3-year-olds) to have opportunities to interact with older preschoolers, as would occur in mixed-age classrooms that serve 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds.",not surprisingli consider attent focus way facilit earli vocabulari develop preschool child lower socioeconom statu background order mitig well document achiev gap area e.g. neuman celano 2001 1997 wasik et 2006 weizman snow 1986 instanc recent research role young ’s peer may play facil- itat henri rickman 2007 justic downer pianta 2009 investig effect within classroom show languag skill classmat signific uniqu predictor growth even beyond attribut instruct qualiti mashburn specifi- calli higher posit relat outcom prekindergarten indic benefit aggreg contain older more cognit advanc particularli true find suggest age composit import understand factor influenc educ set provid inform characterist interact younger year old opportun would occur mix serv 3- 4-
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"Presently, there is a great deal of variability in the age composition of preschool classrooms within the United States. Some classrooms, referred to as  same-age classrooms,  enroll only chil- dren within a particular age range, these typically enroll only 3-year-olds or only 4-year-olds. Other classrooms, characterized as mixed-age classrooms, have children whose ages may span several years (Goodlad & Anderson, 1987, McClellan, 1994) and may serve in one setting chil- dren as young as 3 years and as old as 5 or 6 years (e.g., Winsler et al., 2002). Although the way in which children are grouped within classrooms is highly variable, it is unclear whether class- room age composition has impacts on children’s growth, particularly in the area of vocabulary development. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the extent to which classroom age composition, operationalized based on variation in children’s chronological age, is associated with children’s vocabulary development over an academic year. In addressing this aim, we examined the vocabulary gains of 130 children enrolled in 16 preschool classrooms, which represented a subset of all children enrolled in these classrooms. Given that we did not have information on the ages of all children within the enrolled classrooms, the study represents an exploratory examination of the way in which classroom age composition may influence children’s language growth.",present great deal variabl age composit preschool classroom within some refer enrol chil- dren particular rang typic year old character mix child whose may span sever goodlad anderson 1987 1994 serv one set young e.g. winsler et al 2002 although way group highli unclear whether class- room impact ’s growth particularli area vocabulari develop therefor primari aim studi determin extent operation base variat chronolog associ academ address examin gain 130 16 repres subset all given not inform exploratori influenc languag

From these perspectives, interacting with older, more competent peers seems developmentally beneficial to children because it affords younger children the opportunity to engage in more challenging tasks and therefore experience greater cognitive growth than children without such opportunities. At the same time, it affords older children in such settings the opportunity to scaffold younger children, which may also provide benefits. For instance, younger children can enrich their learning by observing, emulating, and imitating the behaviors of older children (Bandura, 1986), whereas older children can practice prosocial behaviors (Derscheid, 1997, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986) and leadership skills as they serve as mentors for young children by providing support and guid- ance (Wertsch, 1985). In short, mixed-age classrooms provide children with the opportunity to form relations with a wider variety of children compared with their counterparts in same-age classrooms. Whaley and Kantor (1992) explicitly discussed the positive advantages of mixed infant = toddler classrooms, arguing that such classrooms provide children with a ‘‘family’’ and collaborative atmosphere. These researchers also suggested that mixed-age classrooms might help to minimize competitive pressure in terms of academic development by making parents more focused on their children’s individual development, which thereby decreases the competition among peers in the classroom.",cultur vygotski 1930 1978 theori learn develop perspect interact older more compet peer seem development benefici child afford younger opportun engag challeng task therefor experi greater cognit growth than without time set scaffold may also provid benefit instanc can enrich observ emul imit behavior bandura 1986 wherea practic prosoci derscheid 1997 urberg kaplan leadership skill serv mentor young support guid- anc wertsch 1985 short mix age classroom form relat wider varieti compar counterpart whaley kantor 1992 explicitli discuss posit advantag infant toddler argu famili ’’ collabor atmospher research suggest might help minim competit pressur term academ make parent focus ’s individu therebi decreas among

These researchers showed that preschoolers who are closer in age more closely resemble one another in terms of their skill and knowledge develop- ment. In addition, contrary to Whaley and Kantor’s (1992) assertion that older children nurture younger children in mixed-age classrooms, Goldman and Chaille´ (1984) found no evidence that older children engage in more nurturance or mentoring in mixed-age (3- to 5-year-old) groups compared to same-age groups.

Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,1,"There is a great deal of variability in the age composition of U.S. preschool classrooms. Some preschool programs tightly restrict the range of ages in their classrooms (e.g., 3-year-olds only). Other programs permit, and in some cases even promote, a wide range of ages in the same classroom (e.g., from 2.5 years to as old as 5 years). Such variability in practice follows from a lack of consen- sus in both the theoretical and the empirical literature on the effects of age composition of classrooms on individual learning. Research on the effects of classroom age composition on indi- vidual growth is not new. The theoretical writings of two pioneers in the field of early childhood development, Vygotsky and Piaget, are at odds with respect to the predicted impact of exposure of individual children to peers of variant ages on cognitive and social development (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliams, 1993, Hartup, 1993, Piaget, 1932, Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker 1998, Vygotsky,",great deal variabl age composit preschool classroom some program tightli restrict rang e.g. year old permit case even promot wide 2.5 practic follow lack consen- su theoret empir literatur effect individu learn research indi- vidual growth not new write two pioneer field earli childhood develop vygotski piaget odd respect predict impact exposur child peer variant cognit social bailey burchin mcwilliam 1993 hartup 1932 rubin bukowski parker 1998

From one perspective, that of Piaget (1932) and others, interacting with peers who are close in age is preferable. Children close in age are also likely to be more closely matched in terms of knowledge, skill, and power. As a result, children in such a setting are able to engage in and resolve cognitive and social conflicts with each other and play a variety of roles in their resolution. By contrast, Vygotsky and others argued that interac- tion with older, more competent children provides an optimal context for cognitive and behavioral development (Vygotsky, 1930/1978). Interestingly, in the years since, relatively little empirical con- sensus has emerged. Yet despite a lack of consensus, the National Association for the Education of Young Children has given mixed- age classrooms its endorsement 1   (Bredekamp, 1987), in line with several researchers in the field (e.g., Katz, Evangelou, & Hartman, 1990, Whaley & Kantor, 1992).

Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"younger children benefit from being exposed to and modeling the behavior of older children (Bandura, 1986). In support, Rothstein- Fisch and Howes (1988) found that when toddlers interacted with slightly older peers, the younger children exhibited more complex language and engaged in more complex play in a family childcare setting. Howes and Farver (1987) similarly found that toddlers whose play partners were older peers engaged in more complex social play. Other advocates for mixed-age classrooms have posited that older children, too, may benefit from exposure to younger children (Katz et al., 1990, Lloyd, 1999). For example, in such settings older children are in a position to more readily practice prosocial behavior (Derscheid, 1997, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986) and leader- ship skills (French, Waas, Stright, & Baker, 1986), given their elevated status in mixed-age group interactions. Chapman (1994) found that older children in a mixed-age elementary school setting served as mentors for younger children both spontaneously and when asked. Although the specific benefits that have been linked to mixed-age peer interaction have thus far been age specific (i.e., only relevant to younger or older children), advocates of mixed- age classrooms maintain that the age-specific advantages are pre- sumably passed on as a child progresses through such a program (i.e., younger children will one day be older children in the same classroom), and thus an egalitarian ethic is preserved. Further research has suggested additional benefits of mixed-age classrooms for all children, regardless of age. For example, re- search by Goldman (1981) has suggested that both 3- and 4-year- olds in mixed-age preschool classrooms engaged in significantly less parallel (as opposed to interactive) forms of play, relative to those in same-age classrooms. An investigation by Urberg and Kaplan (1986) found that both older and younger children in mixed-age preschool classrooms exhibited greater interactive functional play and less parallel functional play, relative to those in same-age classrooms. Rubin, Maioni, and Hornung (1976) have argued that interactive play represents a more mature level of play, classrooms facilitate more mature play and therefore more optimal social–cognitive development. Whaley and Kantor (1992) suggested that mixed-age classrooms may help to lessen the likelihood of parents and caregivers to make comparisons among children in terms of development. Instead, mixed-age rooms allow parents to focus on each child’s develop- ment as an individual. As such, mixed-age classrooms may de- crease competition between peers, focusing children instead on more mastery-oriented goals. Many studies conducted with chil- dren, adolescents, and college students confirm that focusing on individual standards (i.e., mastery goals) is optimal in terms of maintaining both intrinsic motivation and achievement in the classroom (see Elliot & Dweck, 2005, and Nicholls, 1989, for reviews). Blasco, Bailey, and Burchinal (1993) found that children with developmental disabilities, in particular, were more likely to engage in mastery play when they were enrolled in mixed-age settings. Whaley and Kantor (1992) further speculated that benefits ex- tend to both children and teachers as a result of the “family climate” and continuity of care fostered by mixed-age classrooms. climate encountered when moving between restricted-age class- rooms at larger childcare facilities could be stressful for both the",younger child benefit expos model behavior older bandura 1986 support rothstein- fisch howe 1988 found when toddler interact slightli peer exhibit more complex languag engag play famili childcar set farver 1987 similarli whose partner social advoc mix age classroom posit may exposur katz et al 1990 lloyd 1999 exampl readili practic prosoci derscheid 1997 urberg kaplan leader- ship skill french waa stright baker given elev statu group chapman 1994 elementari school serv mentor spontan ask although specif link thu far i.e. relev mixed- maintain advantag pre- sumabl pass progress program one day egalitarian ethic preserv research suggest addit all regardless re- search goldman 1981 3- year- old preschool significantli less parallel oppos form rel investig greater function rubin maioni hornung 1976 argu repres matur level facilit therefor optim cognit develop whaley kantor 1992 help lessen likelihood parent caregiv make comparison among term instead room allow focu ’s develop- ment individu de- creas competit focus masteri orient goal mani studi conduct chil- dren adolesc colleg student confirm standard intrins motiv achiev see elliot dweck 2005 nichol 1989 review blasco burchin 1993 development disabl particular like enrol specul ex- tend teacher result climat continu care foster encount move restrict class- larger facil could stress

It seems that in mixed- age contexts, age plays a more powerful role than gender in peer playmate selection. Thus, at a society level, long-term promotion of gender equality might be better served by more preschools moving toward a greater diversity in terms of classroom age composition. Such an argument is highly speculative, as no em- pirical explorations into a relation between preschool classroom age composition and attitudes related to gender equality have been conducted. Finally, some research has supported the notion that mixed-age peer interactions occur naturally, outside the classroom context (Ellis, Rogoff, & Cromer, 1981). An observational study by Ellis et al. (1981) of 436 children ages 1–2 found that target children were with same-age peers in only 6% of the observations recorded, compared with 55% of the observations involving mixed-age peer interactions (with children who differed in age by at least 1 year). These findings related to naturalistic social interactions, however, are inconclusive to the extent that this may be because of peer accessibility or children actively seeking out companionship from mixed-age peers. Goldman’s (1981) research on mixed- versus same-age preschool classrooms demonstrated that—within mixed- age classrooms—age did not significantly influence choice of naturally better suited to developing in the context of mixed-age groups (Ellis et al., 1981, Whaley & Kantor, 1992).",teacher child howev empir investig perceiv stress level facil- iti yet publish alent mix age classroom rel restrict set field 1982 louge hartup 1977 roopnarin et al 1992 johnson 1984 seem mixed- context play more power role than gender peer playmat select thu societi long term promot equal might better serv preschool move toward greater divers composit argument highli specul no em- piric explor relat attitud conduct final some research support notion interact occur natur outsid elli rogoff cromer 1981 observ studi 436 1–2 found target record compar 55 involv differ least year find naturalist social inconclus extent may access activ seek companionship goldman ’s versu demonstr within not significantli influenc choic suit develop group whaley kantor
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"The central argument in favor of restricting the range of age in preschool classrooms concerns a desire to provide each child with an optimal degree of challenge and the utility of specialization toward meeting this goal. As such, a criticism that has been levied against mixed-age classrooms in favor of more restricted-age pre- school groupings concerns the development of age-appropriate curriculum and staff training. Specifically, when teacher training and curriculum are uniquely focused on what is developmentally appropriate for a more restricted age range of children, the quality of the classroom climate will be higher. rooms facilitate more mature forms of play (Goldman, 1981, Howes & Farver, 1987, Rothstein-Fisch & Howes, 1998, Urberg & Kaplan, 1986), other researchers have found evidence to the contrary or suggestive of a more complex effect than is often highlighted. For example, Roopnarine et al.

Roopnarine et al. maintained that dramatic play was the more complex form of play relative to manipulative play, suggesting that same-age classrooms facilitated more sophisticated play behaviors.

Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"mixed-age classrooms. For instance, younger children in mixed- age classrooms tended to be involved in a greater number of negative interactions. This was attributed to the potential for frus- tration in older children resulting from interactions with less ma- ture younger children. Furthermore, Urberg and Kaplan found that older children in mixed-age classrooms were more likely to be onlookers, detaching themselves from social interaction. Similarly, Goldman (1981) found more solitary play and less participation in teacher-directed activities among older children in mixed-age classrooms. Urberg and Kaplan speculated that teachers in the mixed-age classrooms might have had a more difficult time pro- viding a sufficient variety of activities suitable for keeping chil- dren of varied age and ability interested and involved. Proponents of mixed-age classrooms often focus on benefits to younger children, but the potential costs to the older children in such classrooms may sometimes be overlooked. A study of mixed- age elementary school classrooms (children ages 6 to 9 years) by Byrnes, Shuster, and Jones (1994) confirmed that both older stu- dents and their parents rated the quality of the academics in multiage classrooms less positively than that in single-age class- rooms. Despite failing to report any benefits found for older, more ought to pay special attention to helping “more able students in seeing how they benefit from being in multiage classrooms” (p. 21). In another observational investigation of play behavior in different classrooms, Dunn, Kontos, and Potter (1996) monitored family childcare homes and found that frequency of interactions with older peers were associated with more complex cognitive play, whereas interactions with younger and same-age peers were associated with less complex social and cognitive play and lower receptive language scores. One lab experiment (Tudge, 1992) compared mixed- versus matched-competence peers (ages 5–9 years) working in dyads. The results of this experiment suggested that regression in thinking was as likely a consequence of mixed groupings as was improvement. These results suggest that at least with regard to some cognitive outcomes, older children in mixed- age groups may suffer. Furthermore, support for such a hypothesis was found by Winsler et al. (2002). Winsler et al. studied longi- tudinally one preschool’s transition from two single-age class- rooms (separate 3- and 4-year-olds) to two mixed-age classrooms (combined 3- and 4-year-olds). In this study, statistical interactions were found between child age and classroom age composition in predicting task focus in the classroom. Although 3-year-olds seemed to do better after the change to mixed-age classrooms, 4-year-olds were observed to be less focused and goal directed. Moreover, children of both ages were observed demonstrating significantly more overt positive affect (e.g., smiles and laughter) and less neutral affect in the single-age classrooms compared with the mixed-aged classrooms. The 1995 meta-analysis conducted by Veenman concluded that there were no academic or social differences between elementary school children attending mixed-age and same-age classrooms. Similarly, Blasco et al. (1993) reported no differences in terms of complex mastery play in same- versus mixed-age classrooms when their observations focused on typically developing preschool-age children, the benefits attributed to mixed-age classrooms and re- ported above were (again) specific to children with developmental disabilities.",mix age classroom instanc younger child mixed- tend involv greater number neg interact attribut potenti frus- tration older result less ma- ture furthermor urberg kaplan found more like onlook detach social similarli goldman 1981 solitari play particip teacher direct activ among specul might difficult time pro- vide suffici varieti suitabl keep chil- dren vari abil interest propon often focu benefit cost may sometim overlook studi elementari school year byrn shuster jone 1994 confirm stu- dent parent rate qualiti academ multiag posit than singl class- room despit fail report ani ought pay special attent help abl student see p. 21 anoth observ investig behavior differ dunn konto potter 1996 monitor famili childcar home frequenc peer associ complex cognit wherea lower recept languag score one lab experi 1992 compar versu match compet 5–9 work dyad suggest regress think consequ group improv least regard some outcom suffer support hypothesi winsler et al 2002 longi- tudin preschool ’s transit two separ 3- old combin statist composit predict task although seem better after chang focus goal moreov demonstr significantli overt affect e.g. smile laughter neutral 1995 meta analysi conduct veenman conclud no attend blasco 1993 term masteri same- when typic develop re- port specif development disabl
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"As noted, many of the theoretical assertions for or against mixed- and restricted-age groupings are based on the assumption that age is closely related to ability. By this token, ability-based groupings may be expected to have an influence on developmental outcomes similar to that of age-based groupings. Mirroring the literature supporting the efficacy of mixed-age classrooms, many researchers have championed mixed-ability groupings in terms of benefits to be reaped by disadvantaged children who are lower in ability (Guralnick, 1981, Rogers & Ross, 1986, Tach & Fargas, 2006). For example, Tach and Fargas (2006) found that within kin- dergarten and first-grade classrooms in which ability-based groupings were used, placement into a higher ability group exerted a uni- formly positive effect on student learning-related behavior and reading achievement. Typically, these studies have implicitly as- sumed that the costs for higher ability children in such mixed- ability groupings are negligible, although several exceptions (e.g., Guralnick, 1981) have reported no detrimental impact on higher ability children in mixed-ability groupings. Nevertheless, a theme that runs through these studies advocating for mixed-ability group- ings is that an important and focal goal is ensuring that the needs of students who have experienced situations that place them at risk or are disadvantageous for their academic development are met. From an entirely different perspective, some researchers have advocated expressly for the interests of the most gifted and tal- ented children. Researchers focused on those children higher in ability tend to advocate for more restricted-ability groupings, such that high-ability children have more opportunities to interact with peers of similar ability (e.g., Gallagher, 1986). To summarize, as is the case in the literature focused on age-related groupings, the literature on ability-related groupings is mixed, furthermore, the most controversial aspect of the debate concerns those children in mixed contexts who are older, higher in ability, or both.",note mani theoret assert mixed- restrict age group base assumpt close relat abil token may expect influenc development outcom similar mirror literatur support efficaci mix classroom research champion term benefit reap disadvantag child lower 1981 roger ross 1986 tach farga 2006 exampl found within kin- dergarten first grade use placement higher exert uni- formli posit effect student learn behavior read achiev typic studi implicitli as- sume cost neglig although sever except e.g. report no detriment impact nevertheless theme run advoc group- ing import focal goal ensur need experienc situat place risk academ develop met entir differ perspect some expressli interest most gift tal- ent focus tend more high opportun interact peer summar case furthermor controversi aspect debat concern context older
Classroom_age_composition_and_developmental change in 70 urban preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Many of the studies that have expressly focused on classroom age composition have targeted an elementary school population, which makes it difficult to extend the conclusions to preschool classrooms (e.g., Chapman, 1994, French et al., 1986, Veenman, 1995). Early childhood (ages 2 to 5) is a period of relatively rapid development, thus, the impact of age differences in classroom composition within this range is likely to be magnified, if not distinctly different, in preschool classrooms relative to that found in elementary school settings among older children. Furthermore, as Winsler et al. (2002, p. 306) pointed out, “most of the (extant) research exploring the effects of age-composition on children’s peer interactions has been conducted in laboratory or quasi-laboratory settings.” In other words, with few exceptions, the extant literature lacks empirical research on preschool classroom age composition conducted in preschool classrooms. The excep- tions (Bailey et al., 1993, Goldman, 1981, Winsler et al., 2002) have been limited to research conducted with a relatively small number of classrooms, typically restricted to a single organization. For example, Bailey et al.’s (1993) investigation tracked the de- velopmental trajectories of just 59 children between the ages of 21 and 67 months.

Furthermore, the samples included in the vast majority of studies reviewed above came from affluent or middle-class suburban communities. From the perspective of triage at the level of public policy, an argument could be made for focusing attention first on the neediest and most underserved populations. Yet, urban samples of lower socioeconomic standing have typically been ignored in this literature. An additional limitation of the extant literature is that researchers have typically focused on a limited range of outcomes, perhaps masking a richer, more ambiguous phenomenon. We undertook an investigation into the question of preschool classroom age composition on a scale far larger than previously conducted (806 children in 70 classrooms), a sample that included every preschool classroom under the administrative umbrella of a public school district in a mid-sized city (approximate popula- tion    212,000). We included as outcomes in our research well- validated measures of various aspects of development (cognitive, social, and motor) and controlled for baseline levels on entering the classroom. Furthermore, we assessed and controlled for gen- eral classroom quality. As a result, this research should offer fresh and rich insight into questions concerning the consequences of preschool classroom age composition that can be extended more easily to urban populations.","classroom winsler et al ’s 2002 sampl includ four furthermor vast major studi review came affluent middl class suburban commun perspect triag level public polici argument could made focus attent first neediest most underserv popul yet urban lower socioeconom stand typic ignor literatur addit limit extant research rang outcom perhap mask richer more ambigu phenomenon undertook investig question preschool age composit scale far larger than previous conduct 806 child 70 everi administr umbrella school district mid size citi approxim popula- tion 212,000 well- valid measur variou aspect develop cognit social motor control baselin enter assess gen- eral qualiti result should offer fresh rich insight concern consequ can extend easili"

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,2,"The zone of proximal development concept is widely accepted and has had considerable influence on early childhood education programs. For example, the zone is commonly used as a rationale for the establishment of literacy-enriched play centers. Traditional dramatic play areas, such as housekeeping and restaurant centers, are stocked with theme-related lit- eracy materials. For example, a restaurant center might be equipped with menus, wall signs, pencils, and notepads (for taking food orders). Research- ers assert that two aspects of these settings encourage children to incorpo- rate familiar literacy routines and activities into their play: (a) the literacy artifacts or tools that are placed into the play center, and (b) opportunities for children to interact with adults and more capable peers in connection with these materials (Christie, 1994, Morrow & Rand, 1991, Neuman & Roskos, 1997, Vukelich, 1993).

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",3,"Abstract: Theorists and researchers have conflicting opinions and findings regarding the role of mixed-age classrooms in  preschool education. According to Piaget interactions with peers of the same age are preferable, since children closer in  age are more likely to learn in similar ways. However, Vygotsky believed that interactions among children of different  ages provide an optimal context for development. The present study aimed at assessing whether mixed or same-age  classroom status affects the quality of peer interactions, teacher-child interactions, and children’s behaviors in the  preschool classroom. Data from 308 teachers placed in three, four, and mixed three- and four-year-old classrooms,  serving children from low socio-economic status in urban preschools, was analyzed using General Linear Models  (GLM). The results have shown that in mixed-age classrooms, teachers reported lower levels of conflicts in peer  interactions (F (1, 302) = 9.92, p = .0001), lower levels of negative teacher-child interactions (F (1, 302) = 6.13, p =  .002), and marginally lower levels of challenging behaviors than in same-age classrooms (F (1,302) = 3.41, p = .06).  The results of this study inform theory and practice regarding the role of mixed-age classrooms in preschool education  and can prove valuable in the development and implementation of preschool programs, especially those serving low- income children.","abstract theorist research conflict opinion find regard role mix age classroom preschool educ accord piaget interact peer prefer sinc child closer more like learn similar way howev vygotski believ among differ provid optim context develop present studi aim assess whether statu affect qualiti teacher ’s behavior data 308 place three four three- year old serv low socio econom urban analyz use gener linear model glm result shown report lower level 302 9.92 .0001 neg 6.13 .002 margin challeng than 1,302 3.41 .06 inform theori practic can prove valuabl implement program especi low- incom"

However, Vygotsky  (1978) believed that interactions among children of different ages provide an optimal context for  development, as both older and younger children benefit from the process of “scaffolding.”  Research has resulted in mixed findings, with several studies supporting the benefits of mixed- age classrooms (Rothstein-Fisher and Howes 1988), and several studies supporting the benefits  of same-age classrooms in preschool education (Moller, Forbes-Jones, and Hightower 2008).",heorist research mix opinion find regard role mixed- age classroom preschool educ accord piaget 1932 interact peer prefer sinc child more like similar problem solv skill construct knowledg way howev vygotski 1978 believ among differ provid optim context develop older younger benefit process scaffold result sever studi support rothstein fisher howe 1988 moller forb jone hightow 2008

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Vygotsky (1978) proposed that children in mixed-aged groups gain social skills during the  process of “scaffolding,” in which a more competent individual supports the learning process of a  less competent one, through social interactions and modeling. Through scaffolding, older  children have the opportunity to develop confidence and leadership skills, while younger children  learn social and language skills from more competent peers. Researchers have found support for  Vygotsky’s ideas. For example, Rothstein-Fisher and Howes (1988) found that younger children  in mixed-age classrooms displayed more complex language use because of their interactions with  older children, as compared to children in same-age classrooms. Similarly, they found that  younger children displayed more complex social and dramatic play skills as a result of their  interactions with older children. Studies have also found several advantages for older children in  mixed-age classrooms. For example, Hercheid (1997) found that interacting with younger  French et al.

For  example, Goldman (1981) observed that in mixed-age classrooms younger and older children  engaged in less parallel play and in more interactive play (Goldman 1981). Similarly, in mixed- age classrooms, parents and teachers made less comparisons based on age and focused more on  children as individuals (Whale and Kantor 1992). This resulted in a decrease in competition  among peers and a focus on mastery-oriented goals. Mixed-age classrooms were found to be  especially beneficial for children with disabilities, who benefit from the decrease in comparison  and competition and the focus on individual goals that is natural in mixed-age classrooms  (Blasco et al. 1993).",research also identifi simultan benefit younger older child exampl goldman 1981 observ mix age classroom engag less parallel play more interact similarli mixed- parent teacher made comparison base focus individu whale kantor 1992 result decreas competit among peer focu masteri orient goal found especi benefici disabl natur blasco et al 1993

Promoting an environment that supports these processes is  considered to be a priority to preschool educators. Classroom age composition might play an  important role in the way children interact with each other, in the way teachers interact with  children, and correspondingly, in the behavioral outcomes of children in the classroom. Positive  peer interactions play a key developmental role in preschool, and they predict a positive  perception of school, better adjustment to kindergarten, and positive academic outcomes in  elementary and high school. On the other hand, poor interactions with peers in preschool are  associated with lower academic performance and emotional maladjustment (McWayne,  Fantuzzo, and McDermott 2004). In addition, peer interactions are especially important for  children in low-income urban areas who experience several challenges, and these interactions  have been shown to be a protective factor by helping children become resilient in the face of  cumulative adversity (Hampton and Fantuzzo 2003).",social process peer interact teacher child repres cornerston earli childhood educ promot environ support consid prioriti preschool classroom age composit might play import role way correspondingli behavior outcom posit key development predict percept school better adjust kindergarten academ elementari high hand poor associ lower perform emot maladjust mcwayn fantuzzo mcdermott 2004 addit especi low incom urban area experi sever challeng shown protect factor help becom resili face cumul advers hampton 2003
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,"Similar to peer-interactions, teacher-child interactions are particularly important in the  preschool classroom (Dobbs and Arnold, 2009). The preschool teacher is generally the first  adult-child interaction outside of the family. Positive teacher-child relationships help children  develop social skills to negotiate challenging situations and help children have a more positive  perception of school (Moritz Rudasill and Rimm-Kaufman 2009). Positive teacher-child  interactions in preschool have a positive influence on children’s language, academic  performance, and social competence in elementary school (McWayne et al. 2004). A child’s  ability to respond to social demands with appropriate behavior is a skill developed during the  preschool years. By the end of the fifth year of life, the level of a child’s ability to control and  moderate his or her behavior in response to social situations remains stable for the rest of his or  her development (Raikes et al. 2007). On the other hand, challenging behaviors are some of the  biggest concerns of preschool teachers, as behavior plays a central role in children’s ability to  transition and adjust to school and succeed academically. Furthermore, most teachers consider  behavior a bigger challenge in early education than a lack of academic skill. For example, Rimm- Kaufman, Pianta, and Cox (2000) found in a national representative group of kindergarten  teachers in the United States, most teachers considered problem behaviors a bigger challenge in  children’s adjustment to kindergarten than academic competency. This finding points to the  importance of looking at the preschool years as a key developmental stage to preventing  challenging behaviors.",similar peer interact teacher child particularli import preschool classroom dobb arnold 2009 gener first adult outsid famili posit relationship help develop social skill negoti challeng situat more percept school moritz rudasil rimm kaufman influenc ’s languag academ perform compet elementari mcwayn et al 2004 abil respond demand appropri behavior year end fifth life level control moder respons remain stabl rest raik 2007 hand some biggest concern play central role transit adjust succeed furthermor most consid bigger earli educ than lack exampl rimm- cox 2000 found nation repres group kindergarten problem find point look key development stage prevent

Continuity and changes in classroom age composition and achievement in Head Start.pdf,2,"composition across school years is grounded in several long-standing educational and developmental models. The overarching framework for our work is based on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory, which emphasizes the importance of contextual in fl uences on children's early learning and development ( Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006 ). In line with this theory, the current investigation considers how speci fi c proximal processes within Head Start classrooms — age composition and teacher continuity — can in fl uence children's academic achievement. Bandura's (1986)  social learning theory and  Vygotsky's (1978)  theory of cognitive development also shape our developmental framework for this study as they both contend that one of the primary mechanisms through which development occurs in early childhood programs is through interactions between children and their classmates. Younger children can observe older and more skilled children in the classroom and mimic their behaviors and actions and older children can sca ff old younger children who, in turn, can cement their own skills and knowledge. When taken together, these transactional processes among peers can constitute one of the key mechanisms through which early childhood programs impact children's academic and social-behavioral development (e.g.,  Henry & Rickman, 2007 ,  Justice, Logan, Lin, & Kaderavek, 2014 ,  Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009 ,  Ribeiro, Zachrisson, & Dearing, 2017 ).",composit across school year ground sever long stand educ development model overarch framework work base bronfenbrenn 's bioecolog theori emphas import contextu fl uenc child earli learn develop morri 2006 line current investig consid speci fi proxim process within head start classroom age teacher continu can academ achiev bandura 1986 social vygotski 1978 cognit also shape studi contend one primari mechan occur childhood program interact classmat younger observ older more skill mimic behavior action sca ff old turn cement knowledg when taken togeth transact among peer constitut key impact e.g. henri rickman 2007 justic lin kaderavek 2014 downer pianta 2009 ribeiro dear 2017

On the other hand, a recent report from the Department of Education clearly shows that the vast majority of educators feel underprepared to individualize and di ff erentiate their instruction ( Manship, Farber, Smith, & Drummond, 2016 ), and therefore, it is also conceivable that regardless of children's prior experiences in mixed-age settings, these types of environments are not optimal for their early learning.

Across North America, there are  currently numerous efforts at the local, state, and federal  levels to improve access to ECE programs for young  children to enhance labor-market participation among  parents (Lefebvre, Merrigan, & Verstraete,  2009 ) and  to improve children’s development of key cognitive  and noncognitive skills as well as readiness for formal  schooling at age 5 years (Winsler et al.,  2008 ). Presently,  in the United States, about 50% of 3- to 5-year-olds  participate in formal full-day center-based ECE  (National Center for Education Statistics,  2017 ), and  this number is likely to increase as many cities and  states press for expanded access to ECE for young  children. In some countries within the European Union,  universal participation in ECE is the norm, including  France, Spain, and Belgium, which each have near  saturation of children in ECE by three years of age, with  an average participation rate of about 80% among the  EU 27 [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD),  2016 ].

Does mixing age groups in early childhood.pdf,2,"Of relevance to the research reported here, when  ECE programs are created and expanded, there are  certain structural features  of such programs that can  be directly affected by the policies that create them.  These features include, for instance, teacher-child ratio,  class size, and teacher credentials. For example,  state-sponsored support of ECE programs might  stipulate a 1:9 teacher-child ratio with a maximum class  size of 18 children, and provision of programming by  teachers with at least a bachelor’s degree. An additional  structural feature often affected by policies is the age  composition of ECE classrooms, as creation/expansion  policies often stipulate the age range of children who  can participate in subsidized programming. For  instance, the Commonwealth of Virginia’s long-running  Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) provides funding  for more than 10,000 4-year-olds across the state to  participate in center-based ECE each year (Huang,  Invernizzi, & Drake,  2012 ).

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"Because of severe economic cuts in the child care budget in Sweden from 1990 to 1993, a sharp increase in the number of children in child care classes has been observed (Lidholt & Norrman, 1994). Average class sizes have risen throughout the country, although there are great differences between, and even within, communities. In the early 1980s, it was rare to have more than 15 children in a class. In 1993, one third of classes had at least 18 children. Simultaneously with the increase in classes, the number of employees in child care centers decreased. During the 1980s, there were, on average, four children per full-time employee. In 1993, the number of children per full-time employee had increased to as much as six (Lidholt & Norrman, 1994). New laws have also had a significant impact on the Swedish child care system. Until 1991, profit-run child care centers could not, based on Swedish law, receive public funding. The average annual cost for one child in public agencies was about $10,000 US in 1993.

Nonprofit private child care in Stockholm has doubled between 1991 and 1994, leaving 16% of all children attending child care in private nonprofit centers and 5% in profit child care. Thus, the transformations that occurred in the beginning of the 1990s within the Swedish child care system make a naturalistic experiment feasible. The main purpose of this study is to examine the potential effects of adult:child ratio and profit child care on teaching and children’s social and cognitive achievements.",instanc privat nonprofit profit child care center receiv approxim subsidi public provid compli specifi qualiti relat paramet e.g. hire train teacher yearli evalu plan access disabl risk doubl 1991 1994 leav 16 all attend thu transform occur begin 1990 within swedish system make naturalist experi feasibl main purpos studi examin potenti effect adult ratio teach ’s social cognit achiev
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"According to Kagan (1991), a nonprofit organization, such as public child care, is unlikely to exploit the consumer (the parents) because it cannot distribute profit to those who control the organization. Conversely, in a profit-oriented organiza- tion, such as profit child care, in which parents cannot directly evaluate the quality of the services the children actually receive and the children are not qualified to evaluate the services themselves, there are motivation and legal sanctions to promote increased profit. Accordingly, profit firms are more likely to cut costs and reduce quality. Based on this reasoning, nonprofit child care centers are likely to be superior in quality relative to profit child care centers. Research does not consistently verify this assumption, however (Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995, Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995). Although profit child care centers have been characterized by lower adult:child ratios, they generally have a better- trained staff (Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995). Group size and the quality of the environment (including quality of interactions between staff and children) are not clearly related to type of child care program (Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995, Kagan, 1991, Penn, 1995). lay persons to influence child care quality and children’s development. Statisti- cally reliable relationships have been moderately positive in some studies (e.g., Clarke-Stewart, Gruber, & Fitzgerald, 1994, Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995, Holloway & Reichart-Erickson, 1988, Howes, Phillips, & Whitebook, 1992, Howes, Rodning, Galluzzo, & Myers, 1988), whereas others (e.g., Broberg, Hwang, Lamb, & Ketterlinus, 1989, Deater-Deckard, Pinkerton, & Scarr, 1996, Palme´rus & Ha¨gglund, 1987, Russel, 1990, Scarr, Eisenberg, & Deater-Deckard, 1994) have failed to support the notion of higher child care quality in cases with higher adult:child ratios. Such contradictory findings suggest the importance of other predictors of child care quality. For instance, a strong consensus among teachers and their aides involves the idea that educational goals and the means to accomplish these goals could compensate for a decreased adult:child ratio. This interpretation is consistent with the findings of Russel (1990) and Palme´rus and Ha¨gglund (1987). Variation in teacher education and experience are also likely relevant in explaining child care quality (Clarke-Stewart et al., 1994). Another possibility is that the relationship between child care quality and adult:child ratio is nonlinear. In this respect, differences in the adult:child ratio have a negligible effect beyond a certain ratio (e.g., 7 children or more per",accord kagan 1991 nonprofit organ public child care unlik exploit consum parent can not distribut profit control convers orient organiza- tion directli evalu qualiti servic actual receiv qualifi motiv legal sanction promot increas accordingli firm more like cut cost reduc base reason center superior rel research consist verifi assumpt howev outcom studi team 1995 penn although character lower adult ratio gener better- train staff group size environ includ interact clearli relat type program lay person influenc ’s develop statisti- calli reliabl relationship moder posit some e.g. clark stewart gruber fitzgerald 1994 holloway reichart erickson 1988 howe phillip whitebook 1992 rodn galluzzo myer wherea other lamb ketterlinu 1989 deater deckard pinkerton scarr 1996 palm ́ru ha ̈gglund 1987 russel 1990 fail support notion higher case contradictori find suggest import predictor instanc strong consensu among teacher aid involv idea educ goal mean accomplish could compens decreas interpret variat experi also relev explain et al anoth possibl nonlinear respect differ neglig effect beyond certain per

The social skills of individuals allow them to participate in learning activities in small groups and learn from each other (Huber & Huber,  2007 ). Vygotsky ( 1978 ) suggested that children ’ s knowledge and ideas develop through interactions with others. In his view social interactions with more capable peers play a key role in under- standing the meaning of concepts, and thus in learning. To achieve this, students need a learning environment that promotes interactive learning processes, preferably from the lower grades of education (Huber & Huber,  2007 ).

Examples of such environments are small mixed-ability cooperative groups, the use of which is supported by extensive evi- dence from numerous studies (e.g. Blumenfeld, Marx, Soloway, & Krajcik,  1996 , Gillies, 2003 , Katz,  1995 , Nastasi & Clements,  1991 ).

Another factor that has proved to be important is the age of the members of a small group. Furman, Rahe, and Hartup ( 1979 ) maintain that socialization in mixed-age groups serves children in many ways that same-age socialization does not, and note that mixed-age groups require accom- modations between individuals whose developmental levels differ.

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"Modeling is the process by which younger children pick up behaviors they observe in older ones. If older students and younger students work closely while engaging in learning activities, the younger students will seek to imitate the behaviors modeled by the older ones (Merrick,  1996 ). Younger children will imitate both academic and social behaviors demonstrated by older children.

Pre-primary teachers are required to implement the National Curriculum for Pre-primary Education, which proposes two kinds of activities for the children:  ‘ free ’ activities, which are chosen and carried out by the children themselves without the direct involvement of the teacher, and  ‘ teacher-organized ’  activities, which are planned and organized by the teacher according to the objectives that have to be met. Teachers can organize activities on topics relating to phenomena that children encounter in every- day life or topics arising out of the children ’ s interests or questions. If the children ’ s inter- ests do not bring up issues which the teacher considers important and appropriate for pre- primary children, she/he can design activities to meet a selected objective, choosing the topic, content and instruction materials accordingly. Domains from which the topics for activities can be drawn include physics and outer space. The physics curriculum pro- poses topics relating to concepts such as weight, sound, light, motion, temperature and magnetism, basic characteristics of materials and properties of matter such as  fl oating/ sinking, melting, dissolving in water, etc. Space-related topics include Earth ’ s sphericity and motions and the phenomenon of day and night.

In primary school, the teaching of topics related to physics and outer space starts systemati- cally at the fourth grade. However, in a framework called  ‘ Flexible Zone of Activities, ’  the National Curriculum for Primary Education provides opportunities for innovative peda- gogical and didactical approaches (e.g. classes of children from different grades) and allows the introduction of concepts and phenomena that complement those introduced through the formal program and enhance the basic skills that the formal activities pro- posed by the curriculum are expected to develop. These may be related to experiences that children commonly encounter in everyday life. Teachers may also identify topics that they consider to be interesting, important and appropriate for children of speci fi c ages, which may not be included in the tight weekly timetable of the school program.

Traditionally, group work involves four to six students (Huber & Huber,  2007 ). In our study, groups of  fi ve students were formed. We felt that this was a number that provides good opportunities for interaction between members and allows for different age combinations within the group. Since each child has a probability of interacting with each of the others in the group, we assumed that when there are fewer younger than older children in a group, each of the younger children will have a higher probability of interacting with an older one. Thus, for the purpose of our study, we varied the number of younger children in the groups in each of the classes, keeping the total size of each group at 5 (all groups in a class had the same age composition).",activ child work group tradit involv four six student huber 2007 studi fi form felt number provid good opportun interact member allow differ age combin within sinc probabl other assum when fewer younger than older higher one thu purpos vari class keep total size all composit

Many studies have been devoted to the quality of professional child care and its effects on the children’s well-being and development (for reviews see Lamb, 1998 ,  Vandell & Wolfe, 2000 ). Nevertheless, what determines the quality of caregiving behavior in professionals involved in the care of young children remains unclear. Ample studies have been dedicated to the explication of individual differences in  parental caregiving behavior and many were inspired by Belsky’s (1984)  seminal model of the determinants of parenting. The model assumes parenting to be shaped by multiple determinants in three domains: (1) parental personality or personal psychological resources, (2) child characteristics, and (3) contextual sources of stress and support. Because there was no theoretical model available for professional caregiving, Belsky’s model was used as a guideline for our choice of potential determinants. In keeping with the model, we hypothesized three groups of characteristics to multiply determine the quality of nonparental caregiving: (1) personal characteristics of the caregiver, (2) characteristics of the child care group, and (3) characteristics of the caregiving context. Before reporting on the present study, we will first elaborate our hypotheses with regard to each group of determinants within the perspective of earlier research.",qualiti caregiv profession child care center establish import influenc variou aspect develop nichd eccrn 2003 duncan mani studi devot effect ’s well review see lamb 1998 vandel wolf 2000 nevertheless determin behavior involv young remain unclear ampl dedic explic individu differ parent inspir belski 1984 semin model assum shape multipl three domain person psycholog resourc characterist contextu sourc stress support no theoret avail use guidelin choic potenti keep hypothes group multipli nonparent context befor report present first elabor hypothesi regard within perspect earlier research

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,2,"In parents, personal characteristics such as personality, age, and level of education have been found to affect the quality of caregiving ( Belsky & Barends, 2002 ,  Clark, Kochanska, & Ready, 2000 ,  Kochanska, Friesenborg, Lange, & Martel, 2004 ,  Van Bakel & Riksen-Walraven, 2002 ). Yet, very few studies have examined the effect of the personal characteristics of professional caregivers on the quality of their care and those that have, have done so with a quite restricted focus, i.e., the effects of their depressive symptoms. Similar to the findings in parents, results indicated that caregivers reporting more depressive symptoms displayed a lower-quality of caregiving behavior than those reporting fewer depressive symptoms ( Hamre & Pianta, 2004 ). In a previous study on the present sample of professional caregivers ( De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, Geurts, & Derksen, 2006 ), their self-reported general mood (i.e., optimism and happiness) was found to be significantly and positively related with the quality of their care as observed during a structured play episode. In the present study, caregiver general mood is also expected to show a relation with caregiver behavior in other caregiving situations.",parent person characterist age level educ found affect qualiti caregiv belski barend 2002 clark 2000 kochanska friesenborg lang martel 2004 van bakel riksen walraven yet few studi examin effect profession care done quit restrict focu i.e. depress symptom similar find result indic report more display lower behavior than fewer hamr pianta previou present sampl de schipper geurt derksen 2006 self gener mood optim happi significantli posit relat observ structur play episod also expect show situat

To date, this has not been confirmed for the Netherlands, which is possibly due to the restricted variance in the educational levels of the professional caregivers working in Dutch child care centers ( De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts, 2006 ,  Gevers Deynoot-Schaub & Riksen-Walraven, 2005 , Van IJzendoorn, Tavecchio, Stams, Verhoeven, & Reiling, 1998 ). In the Netherlands, most child care workers receive the same general vocational training, which does not specifically prepare them to work with very young children. Hence, much has to be learned from hands-on experience. Therefore, rather than caregiver education, in the present study we expected caregiver work experience to be related to the quality of professional caregiving as has earlier been observed by  Gevers Deynoot-Schaub and Riksen-Walraven (2005)  although this was not confirmed by other Dutch studies ( Van IJzendoorn et al., 1998, Vermeer et al., 2005 ).",educ level profession caregiv also frequent report associ qualiti care provid lamb 1998 vandel wolf 2000 date not confirm possibl due restrict varianc work dutch child center de schipper riksen walraven geurt 2006 gever deynoot schaub 2005 van ijzendoorn verhoeven reil most worker receiv gener vocat train specif prepar young henc much learn hand experi therefor rather than present studi expect relat earlier observ although et al vermeer

As caring for groups of young children in professional child care settings is generally considered to be strenuous and stressful, a good physical condition and the absence of health problems are crucial. Particularly in the field of care and education it is quite common, though, for staff to continue working when they are suffering from health problems ( Aronson, Gustafsson, & Dallner, 2000 ) and in various professions a negative relation between health problems and job performance has been found ( Roe, 2003 ).

Because in child care centers caregiver interactions mostly involve more than one child, we defined child characteristics at the level of the care group. For the purposes of the present study large group size, high child-caregiver ratio and younger mean age of the children were deemed relevant care group characteristics. The first two variables have been associated with lower-quality caregiving in numerous studies ( Vandell & Wolfe, 2000 ,  NICHD ECCRN, 2002a, b ). In an earlier study with the current sample, observations during a structured play session revealed that the quality of caregiver–child interactions was lower in the groups containing more children per caregiver (5 versus 3), especially when they included younger children ( De Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts, 2006 ).

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,"The third group of determinants, i.e., contextual characteristics, is of special interest in the field of professional child care. Surprisingly little attention has been awarded to the potential impact of the work environment of professional child care providers on the quality of their care, despite the wide recognition of the demands and stress involved in the job.  Phillips, Howes, and Whitebook (1991)  found more favorable working conditions to be related to a higher-quality of care. Moreover, they reported a positive relation between higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates on the one hand and quality of care on the other. Accordingly, in the present study we anticipated quantitative and qualitative workload in the workplace to be associated with lower-quality caregiving and, secondly, that supportive relations with colleagues and supervisors would positively affect the caregivers’ behavior toward the children.  Belsky’s postulation has been confirmed in numerous studies (for a review see  Cochran & Niego, 2002 ). Although we also took the support examined this association before, studies in the field of occupational psychology have shown that supportive relations with coworkers within the job setting boosted job performance in other professions ( AbuAlRub, 2004 ,  Beehr, Jex, Stacy, & Murray, 2000 ).",third group determin i.e. contextu characterist special interest field profession child care surprisingli littl attent award potenti impact work environ provid qualiti despit wide recognit demand stress involv job phillip howe whitebook 1991 found more favor condit relat higher moreov report posit satisfact lower turnov rate one hand accordingli present studi anticip quantit qualit workload workplac associ caregiv secondli support colleagu supervisor would affect behavior toward belski ’s postul confirm numer review see cochran niego 2002 although also took examin befor occup psycholog shown cowork within set boost perform profess abualrub 2004 jex staci murray 2000

As explained above, in line with  Belsky’s 1984 model of the determinants of parenting, we expected factors in three domains to independently contribute to the quality of professional caregiving. In sum, with regard to the first domain, i.e., the professional caregiver’s personal characteristics, we expected a higher-quality of caregiving to be associated with a better general mood, more professional experience, a higher age, and fewer health problems.

This information may be helpful in interpreting the possible effects of the specific predictors of caregiver behavior included in the present study, as well as in discussing possible sources of the variance that remains  un explained by the present predictors. We expected part of the variance in the behavior of the professional caregivers to lie at the level of the child care group and at the level of the child care center.

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"Peer interactions provide opportunities for young children to gain social practice and experience and  to build healthy peer relationships, thus, they will eventually and profoundly impact their socio­ emotional development (Blerta,  2019 ). Peer interactions include those interactions between same-age  peers as well as between mixed-age peers. However, most preschool classrooms in the world are  arranged by age, thus only having same-age peer interactions, which are an important part of the daily  routine in early childhood programs. Consequently, young children in the same-age classrooms will be  suffering from the lacking of mixed-age peer interactions. This problem is more serious in China, as it  has implemented the only-child policy for 30 years and has made most Chinese children the only child  in their families (Li et al.,  2020 ). This means that these Chinese only children have been deprived of the  opportunities of having mixed-age peer interactions at home and in preschool, which will unfortu­ nately and negatively impact their social development (Zhang,  2004 ).

In contrast, MA preschool classrooms might  increase the hierarchical structure and level of complexity in group interactions, while SA classrooms  might have relatively equal and comparable young children around the same level. Therefore, peer  interactions in MA classrooms can provide opportunities for older children to practice and develop  prosocial, self-regulatory, and leadership skills, while younger children gain scaffolds for growth as  they receive help from older children (Winsler et al.,  2002 ). Compared to those in SA classrooms,  young children in MA classrooms have more play styles, more prosocial behaviors, and tend to depend  on peers rather than teachers in daily routine (Howes & Farver,  1987 , Mounts & Roopnarine,  1987 ).

Examples of physical literacy materials include books, writing utensils,  language-based puzzles, and alphabet displays. Additionally, certain classroom areas may be desig­ nated for reading and writing, while areas utilized for other subjects and activities could incorporate  these resources (Smith & Dickinson,  2002 ).

The current study focuses on four emergent literacy skills that have  been highlighted as the key instructional focus in the preschool period: Receptive and expressive  vocabulary and phonological awareness and print knowledge (Lonigan et al.,  2011 ). Although these  four skills are moderately to highly correlated (Cabell et al.,  2011 , Storch & Whitehurst,  2002 ), they are  also strong and independent predictors of reading and writing acquisition (Pullen & Justice,  2003 ).",emerg literaci highlight develop start earli age prior formal read write instruct term skill refer varieti foundat enabl fluent storch whitehurst 2002 lonigan 1998 current studi focu four key preschool period recept express vocabulari phonolog awar print knowledg et al 2011 although moder highli correl cabel also strong independ predictor acquisit pullen justic 2003

However, research has shown inconsistent associations between  preschool classroom social interactional quality and children’s emergent literacy skills (Burchinal,   2016 , Perlman et al.,  2016 ). Thus, there have been calls for attention to other aspects of classroom  experiences highlighted by bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner & Morris,  1998 ), such as the objects  and symbols available to children that play a unique and predictive role in their development (Wachs,   (Altun et al.,  2018 , Guo et al.,  2012 ), which includes the availability, display, and arrangement of  literacy materials, such as books, print sources, and writing instruments (Altun et al.,  2018 , Guo et al.,   2012 , Wolfersberger et al.,  2004 ).

Bioecological theory suggests that the organization, structure, and complexity of the physical  environment not only stimulates solitary interactions with objects and symbols, but also provides  conditions and stimuli for interpersonal interactions involving literacy-related instruction and mod­ eling (Bronfenbrenner & Morris,  2006 ). In addition, sociocultural theory emphasizes that children’s  internalization and use of symbols and signs are first supported by the presence of props and object-  orientated play, which involves physical interaction with objects and materials (Vygotsky,  1978 ).",when consid physic literaci environ sever theoret explan shed light may shape child ’s emerg learn bioecolog theori suggest organ structur complex not stimul solitari interact object symbol also provid condit stimulu interperson involv relat instruct mod­ ele bronfenbrenn morri 2006 addit sociocultur emphas intern use sign first support presenc prop object- orient play materi vygotski 1978

For example,  children in intervention classrooms that were enriched with literacy objects in targeted play areas  (e.g., the cozy corner library) were observed to spend more time engaging in reading and writing  activities, incorporate literacy objects in more diverse and functional ways, and use more explicit  language than the nonintervention group (Neuman & Roskos,  1992 ). In another study, classrooms  with high-quality classroom physical literacy environments were strongly associated with children’s  general literacy interest and engagement in literacy activities. These factors, in turn, predicted their  phonological awareness and expressive vocabulary (Baroody & Diamond,  2016 ). Several studies  further demonstrate direct associations between the physical literacy environment and emergent  literacy acquisition. For example, Arteaga et al. ( 2019 ) found a positive association between engaging  with a high-quality physical literacy environment and children’s print knowledge. Similarly, other  studies have found that the quality of the classroom literacy area is significantly associated with  children’s alphabet knowledge and name-writing abilities (Guo et al.,  2012 , Zhang et al.,  2015 ) as well  as expressive and receptive vocabulary and phonological awareness (Altun et al.,  2018 ). These findings  suggest that there are links between features of the physical literacy environment and children’s  emergent literacy skills (Altun et al.,  2018 , Guo et al.,  2012 , Palmer et al.,  2018 , Xu et al.,  2014 ).",classroom rich literaci materi area found increas frequenc durat complex relat play neuman rosko 1990 1992 exampl child intervent enrich object target e.g. cozi corner librari observ spend more time engag read write activ incorpor divers function way use explicit languag than nonintervent group anoth studi high qualiti physic environ strongli associ ’s gener interest factor turn predict phonolog awar express vocabulari baroodi diamond 2016 sever demonstr direct emerg acquisit arteaga et al 2019 posit print knowledg similarli significantli alphabet name abil guo 2012 zhang 2015 well recept altun 2018 find suggest link featur skill palmer xu 2014

Given the less  formal regulations around preschool in the United States, mixed-age classrooms, which include  children of multiple age groups, are widely used. For example, according to national statistics, over  75% of children in Head Start, the largest publicly funded preschool program in the United States, are  enrolled in mixed-age classrooms serving both 3- and 4-year-olds (Moiduddin et al.,  2012 ). National  data also reveal that roughly 65% of preschool classrooms, including those in publicly funded  programs, have over a 12-month age difference between the oldest and youngest children, with 35%  reporting an age difference of 18 months or greater (National Survey of Early Care and Education,   2012 ). These findings underscore the considerable enrollment of preschoolers in mixed-age class­ rooms, although the distribution of children in different age groups varies across states and programs  (Ansari et al.,  2016 ). Therefore, the current study focuses on the variation in the percentage of children  in each age group as indicators of classroom age composition.",anoth notabl featur classroom may shape literaci environ age child commonli refer composit moller et al 2008 given less formal regul around preschool mix includ multipl group wide use exampl accord nation statist 75 head start largest publicli fund program enrol serv 3- year old moiduddin 2012 data also reveal roughli 65 12 month differ oldest youngest 35 report 18 greater survey earli care educ find underscor consider class­ room although distribut vari across state ansari 2016 therefor current studi focu variat percentag indic

A preliminary pattern identified in previous studies  suggests that older children in classrooms with a higher proportion of younger peers may gain less in  emergent literacy skills, corresponding to 2 to 5 months of academic development (Ansari et al.,  2016 ).  However, the mechanisms that link classroom age composition to children’s learning are still unclear.  and the variability in classroom age composition.

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"As part of the current study, we propose that the classroom physical literacy environment may  function as a potential mechanism through which classroom age composition shapes children’s  emergent literacy learning. There is indirect evidence regarding links between classroom age compo­ sition and teachers’ practices that lends support to this hypothesis. For example, Ansari and Pianta  ( 2019 ) found that greater classroom age diversity creates challenges for teachers to provide children  with high quality emotional and instructional support. As another example, teachers serving class­ rooms with a larger proportion of younger children have been found to provide less opportunity for  children to engage in group and academic instruction (Ansari,  2017 ). Similarly, classroom age  composition may also shape the classroom physical literacy environment due to teachers’ beliefs  about young children’s literacy learning and development, which is discussed below.",part current studi propos classroom physic literaci environ may function potenti mechan age composit shape child ’s emerg learn indirect evid regard link compo­ sition teacher practic lend support hypothesi exampl 2019 found greater divers creat challeng provid high qualiti emot instruct anoth serv class­ room larger proport younger less opportun engag group academ ansari 2017 similarli also due belief young develop discuss

For example,  a study of Head Start teachers revealed that teachers often believed that young children  should only engage with literacy materials after mastering social-behavioral skills, such as  following directions, abiding by classroom rules, and relating to peers (Powell et al.,  2008 ).  Teachers’ beliefs about the degree to which children should learn emergent literacy skills at  young ages have been found to be positively associated with the amount of teachers’ language  and literacy-related instructional practices (Schachter et al.,  2016 ). Therefore, teachers with the  above-mentioned beliefs may provide fewer literacy-related materials and spaces when teach­ ing in classrooms with a higher percentage of younger children. For example, in a classroom  with more 3-year-olds, teachers may provide books with less engaging and complex narratives,  and fewer writing materials (e.g., pencils, papers, word cards, templates), and writing dis­ played around the room (e.g., signs, posters, charts, and children’s writing displays).

Practically, these findings provide ideas for potential professional development and  ongoing support for teachers that can help them manage problem behavior and improve the overall teacher-child interaction quality.",due import teacher child interact qualiti learn develop studi aim understand behavior aggreg level relat part work also examin role mix age classroom i.e. serv differ make roughli 75 relationship problem given development trajectori regulatori capac preschool period expect year old older e.g. elucid averag across contribut head start result can assist program better may practic find provid idea potenti profession ongo support help manag improv overal
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"Teacher-child interaction quality is one of the most important contributors to children ’ s social and academic development during  preschool ( Burchinal, 2018 ,  Burchinal et al., 2015 ). High-quality preschools influence children ’ s learning and development in various  domains, including children ’ s motivation to learn, socioemotional and behavioral skills, and development of positive peer relation­ ships ( La Paro et al., 2004 ,  Schmitt et al., 2018 ). Teacher-child interaction quality is characterized by teachers ’  practices and behaviors  such as their social interactions with children and instructional practices ( Pianta et al., 2008 ). Three domains of teacher-child  interaction quality are recognized as critical contributors to children ’ s learning and development: (a) emotional support, (b) class­ room organization, and (c) instructional support ( Hamre et al., 2014 ).  Emotional support  is characterized by warm, sensitive,  responsive, and individualized interactions.  Classroom organization  is defined as how well teachers structure and manage classroom  activities, routines, and materials to support children ’ s self-regulation, attention, and engagement in learning. Finally,  instructional  support reflects a teacher ’ s use of cognitively stimulating practices with children, such as encouraging problem-solving, higher-order  reasoning, and more advanced language ( La Paro et al., 2004 ). To date, a substantial literature has examined predictors of quality at  the program- and teacher-level in preschool settings (e.g.,  Manning et al., 2019 ,  Tout et al., 2006 ), but rarely has the association with  children ’ s behavior and teacher-child interaction quality been examined.",teacher child interact qualiti one most import contributor social academ develop preschool burchin 2018 et al 2015 high influenc learn variou domain includ motiv socioemot behavior skill posit peer relation­ ship la paro 2004 schmitt character practic instruct 2008 three recogn critic emot support class­ room organ hamr 2014 warm sensit respons individu classroom defin well structur manag activ routin materi self regul attent engag final reflect use cognit stimul encourag problem solv higher order reason more advanc languag date substanti literatur examin predictor program- level set e.g. man 2019 tout 2006 rare associ
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"In the literature, the two types of problem behaviors that typically are examined include externalizing behaviors and internalizing  behaviors (e.g.,  Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2005 ,  Williford  &  Wolcott, 2015 ). In the present study, we examined three teacher-reported  problem behaviors: (a) oppositional/aggressive, (b) hyperactivity, and (c) internalizing behavior. Children ’ s oppositional/aggres­ sive behaviors (often conceptualized as a component of externalizing behavior) are characterized by overt hostility, conduct problems,  and oppositional defiance behaviors ( Whitcomb, 2013 ). Extant research shows that children who exhibit oppositional/aggressive  behaviors are less likely to engage successfully in classroom activities ( Moffett  &  Morrison, 2020 ,  Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2005 ). Hy­ peractive behaviors such as impulsivity and inattention frequently are operationalized as a dimension of externalizing behavior (along  with oppositional/aggressive) in preschool (e.g.,  Montroy et al., 2014 ,  Williford  &  Wolcott, 2015 ). However, research suggests that  even though oppositional/aggressive and hyperactive behaviors correlate, they are distinct dimensions of problem behavior and have  different implications for children ’ s academic and social functioning ( Gustafsson et al., 2018 ). Internalizing behaviors, such as extreme  shyness, social withdrawal, and anxiety, are described as directed towards the self ( Whitcomb, 2013 ). Children who exhibit inter­ nalizing behaviors are often unable to form strong peer relationships and are more likely to engage in isolating behaviors and social  withdrawal (e.g.,  Oland  &  Shaw, 2005 ).",literatur two type problem behavior typic examin includ extern intern e.g. rimm kaufman et al 2005 williford 2015 present studi three teacher report opposit aggress hyperact child aggres­ sive often conceptu compon character overt hostil conduct defianc whitcomb 2013 extant research show exhibit less like engag success classroom activ moffett 2020 hy­ peract impuls inattent frequent operation dimens along preschool montroy 2014 howev suggest even though correl distinct differ implic academ social function gustafsson 2018 extrem shyness withdraw anxieti describ direct toward self inter­ naliz unabl form strong peer relationship more isol oland shaw
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"Extant research focuses on how teacher-child interaction quality relates to children ’ s skills and behavior. For example, emotionally  supportive, well-managed, and higher-quality instructional classrooms reduce individual children ’ s problem behaviors (e.g.,  Hamre  &  Pianta, 2005 ,  La Paro et al., 2004 ). However, the reverse relationship (i.e., the extent to which children ’ s problem behaviors influence  the quality of teacher-child interaction quality) is under-researched. To conceptualize the role that problem behaviors at the  classroom-level may have on teacher-child interaction quality, we draw upon the literature on transactional models, which posits that  development is a consequence of the ongoing dynamic interaction between children and their environment ( Sutherland  &  Oswald,  2005 ). Although we did not test the bidirectional relationship between problem behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality, this  teacher-child interaction quality.  &  Kiuru, 2015 ). First, problem behavior displayed by children can negatively affect teacher-child relationships and place an extra  burden or stress on teachers. This stress can evoke negative affective, behavioral, and cognitive responses in teachers towards (all)  children ( Nurmi  &  Kiuru, 2015 ), undermining teacher-child interaction quality by introducing a  “ burnout cascade ”  response from  teachers in which children ’ s behaviors and teachers ’  responses to their behaviors continue to worsen over time and teacher-child",extant research focu teacher child interact qualiti relat skill behavior exampl emot support well manag higher instruct classroom reduc individu problem e.g. hamr pianta 2005 la paro et al 2004 howev revers relationship i.e. extent influenc conceptu role level may draw upon literatur transact model posit develop consequ ongo dynam environ sutherland oswald although not test bidirect kiuru 2015 first display can neg affect place extra burden stress evok cognit respons toward all nurmi undermin introduc burnout cascad continu worsen time

Second, children ’ s problem behaviors also can influence peers to exhibit  problem behaviors (i.e., a contagion effect) whereby children ’ s problem behaviors encourage behavior problems among their peers  ( Bulotsky-Shearer et al., 2012 ,  Rojas et al., 2020 ).",interact qualiti declin jen greenberg 2009 second child problem behavior also can influenc peer exhibit i.e. contagion effect wherebi encourag among bulotski shearer et al 2012 roja 2020
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Teacher-child interaction quality may vary depending on the type of classroom-level problem behavior displayed. As posited by the  burnout cascade theory, teachers tend to feel more negative and stressed when they perceive aggression/opposition behavior in the  classroom, leading to anger and frustration because these behaviors hamper their teaching ability ( Bosman et al., 2019 ). Moreover,  following the contagion theory, children also exhibit more aggression/opposition when in classrooms with higher levels of aggression/  opposition ( Thomas et al., 2011 ). Classroom-level aggression/opposition often inhibits teachers ’  ability to provide consistent  emotional support and positive behavior management ( Zinsser et al., 2013 ) and reduces the available instructional time ( Long et al.,  2018 ). However, contrary to other prior research,  Friedman-Krauss et al. (2014)  found that higher levels of child aggression/oppo­ sition behavior problems in the fall were related to higher classroom emotional climate in the spring, over and above fall emotional  climate and child-, teacher-, and classroom-level covariates. These mixed results suggest that more work is needed to understand the  relationship between classroom-level aggression/opposition and teacher-child interaction quality, considering research suggesting  that aggression/opposition behaviors are related to more negative behaviors among peers and teachers, we posited an exploratory  hypothesis that higher levels of classroom aggression/opposition behavior may be negatively related to the emotional climate and  classroom organization.",teacher child interact qualiti may vari depend type classroom level problem behavior display posit burnout cascad theori tend feel more neg stress when perceiv aggress opposit lead anger frustrat hamper teach abil bosman et al 2019 moreov follow contagion also exhibit higher aggression/ thoma 2011 often inhibit provid consist emot support manag zinsser 2013 reduc avail instruct time long 2018 howev contrari prior research friedman krauss 2014 found oppo­ sition fall relat climat spring child- teacher- covari mix result suggest work need understand relationship consid among peer exploratori hypothesi organ
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Like the extant literature on classroom-level aggression/opposition, there are mixed findings regarding the relationship between  classroom-level hyperactivity and teacher-child interaction quality. In  Partee et al. (2020) , classroom-level hyperactivity was nega­ tively related to classroom management ( β  = − 0.15,  p  =  0.04) and instructional support ( β = − 0.19,  p  =  0.01) and marginally related to  negative emotional support at the end of the year. However, in  Bosman et al. (2019) , teachers reported using more sensitive practices  when responding to individual children ’ s hyperactive behaviors in the classroom. Teachers ’  increased sensitivity for hyperactive  behaviors among children may be due to greater awareness about hyperactivity and symptoms of ADHD and when teachers understand  what children are not able to or otherwise struggle to control their behavior in the classroom, this may influence the sensitivity of their  teaching in a positive way ( Chang  &  Davis, 2009 ). Given these mixed results, we hypothesized that higher rates of classroom-level  hyperactivity would be negatively related to emotional support and classroom organization.",like extant literatur classroom level aggress opposit mix find regard relationship hyperact teacher child interact qualiti parte et al 2020 nega­ tive relat manag 0.15 0.04 instruct support 0.19 0.01 margin neg emot end year howev bosman 2019 report use more sensit practic when respond individu behavior increas among may due greater awar symptom adhd understand not abl otherwis struggl control influenc teach posit way chang davi 2009 given result hypothes higher rate would organ
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Less attention has been paid to the association between children ’ s internalizing behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality.  Compared to children with more disruptive problem behaviors like externalizing and hyperactivity behaviors, children with inter­ nalizing symptoms often receive less attention from teachers because their problems are less apparent and more difficult to detect  ( Berg-Nielsen et al., 2012 ). Yet, teachers who do not aid and comfort children struggling with internalizing problems may increase  children ’ s anxiety withdrawal symptoms, which can negatively impact teacher-child interaction quality ( Jeon et al., 2019 ).  Buyse et al.  (2008)  found that higher average levels of internalizing behavior in the classroom significantly predicted more relational conflict  between teachers and children, suggesting that classroom-level internalizing behavior may negatively affect emotional support.  Children ’ s internalizing behavior, which is in part a function of children ’ s ability to manage emotional distress, is expected to be most  strongly linked to the quality of emotional support in the classroom.",less attent paid associ child intern behavior teacher interact qualiti compar more disrupt problem like extern hyperact inter­ naliz symptom often receiv appar difficult detect berg nielsen et al 2012 yet not aid comfort struggl may increas anxieti withdraw can neg impact jeon 2019 buys 2008 found higher averag level classroom significantli predict relat conflict suggest affect emot support part function abil manag distress expect most strongli link
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Children ’ s behavior and teacher-child interaction quality may unfold and interact differently in classrooms serving older children  versus classrooms serving children across a broader age range. For example, although some Head Start programs serve 3- and 4-year-  olds in separate classrooms, most Head Start programs combine 3- and 4-year-olds in mixed-age classrooms ( Ansari  &  Pianta, 2019 ).  However, to our knowledge, only Guo et al. (2014)  investigated interrelations among age composition, teacher-child interaction  quality, and children ’ s skills and found that mixed-age classrooms were beneficial for preschoolers, but only when coupled with high-  quality interactions. In addition, prior studies have not examined, to our knowledge, the extent to which the age grouping of class­ rooms (same-age or mixed-age) interacts with classroom-level problem behaviors to contribute to teacher-child interaction quality.",child behavior teacher interact qualiti may unfold differ classroom serv older versu across broader age rang exampl although some head start program 3- year- old separ most combin year mix ansari pianta 2019 howev knowledg guo et al 2014 investig interrel among composit skill found benefici preschool when coupl high- addit prior studi not examin extent group class­ room level problem contribut
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"We predicted that mixed-age classrooms would moderate the relationship between classroom-level problem behaviors and teacher-  child interaction quality based on the theoretical and limited empirical literature. However, the direction of the hypothesis remained  exploratory given the limited prior research and theory. It is plausible that the negative association between classroom-level problem  behaviors and teacher-child interaction quality may be even more pronounced in mixed-age classrooms than in classrooms serving 4-  year-olds where the association may be less pronounced or non-existent. Prior studies suggest that managing a classroom with a wide  range of ages and diverse needs can be challenging ( Guo et al., 2014 ) and uniquely stressful to teachers ( Friedman-Krauss et al., 2014 ).  A mixed-age classroom with a broader range of behaviors and developmental skills could be negatively related to a teacher ’ s ability to  provide high-quality instructional support, emotional support, and classroom organization. For example,  Ansari and Pianta (2019)  found that teachers who taught in mixed-age classrooms demonstrated less optimal teacher-child interaction quality. Therefore, it is  plausible that mixed-age grouping is negatively related to teacher-child interaction quality ( Ansari  &  Pianta, 2019 ), that classroom-  level problem behaviors are negatively related to teacher-child interaction quality ( Partee et al., 2020 ), and that these challenges  are magnified when in combination, resulting in lower teacher-child interaction quality.",predict mix age classroom would moder relationship level problem behavior teacher- child interact qualiti base theoret limit empir literatur howev direct hypothesi remain exploratori given prior research theori plausibl neg associ teacher may even more pronounc than serv 4- year old less non exist studi suggest manag wide rang divers need can challeng guo et al 2014 uniqu stress friedman krauss broader development skill could relat abil provid high instruct support emot organ exampl 2019 found taught demonstr optim therefor group ansari pianta classroom- parte 2020 magnifi when combin result lower

It is plausible that teachers may perceive behavioral challenges and react to them  differently in mixed-age classrooms versus classrooms serving only 4-year-olds. For instance, in mixed-age classrooms, 3-year-old  perceive that behavior as more developmentally appropriate, they may warmly comfort those children, which is associated with higher  quality classrooms. Conversely, more classroom-level problem behaviors in 4-year-old only classrooms may be related to lower  teacher-child interaction quality because teachers see oppositional/aggressive, hyperactivity, and internalizing behaviors as inap­ propriate for 4-year-olds. In other words, expectations about children in mixed-age classrooms may have buffered preschool teachers  against the difficulties of handling more behavioral challenging classrooms.

In addition,  teachers may find same-age settings to be easier because they do not have to plan  and prepare activities for children of diverse developmental levels. Conversely,  mixed-age settings provide opportunities for younger children to learn by observ-  ing competent older peers.

A similar pattern was observed  for mean length of utterance. Task orientation did not differ among the groups.  Howes and Farver (1987) studied dyads in which 2-year-olds were paired either  with same-age or 5-year-old partners. Toddlers engaged in more social pretend  play when paired with the older children. Brownell (1990) observed dyads of 18-  and 24-month-old toddlers and found that the younger children were more inter-  active and more positive when paired with an older child than with an age-mate.  They initiated more, produced more complex initiations, and imitated older  partners more than same-age peers.

The laboratory  studies have relied on observations of dyads of children who were not previously  acquainted. Because Mueller and Brenner (1977) showed that acquainted tod-  dlers were more likely to interact with each other in a sustained fashion than  nonacquainted peers, the question is raised of whether this research would gener-  alize to the typical day-care or play group context consisting of more children, all  of whom are acquainted with each other. The group studies, however, have not  randomly assigned children to conditions or standardized observational environ-  ments or adult roles. For example, in Field's (1982) study, each same-age group  contained 8 children, whereas the mixed-age groups contained 24 children.  Goldman's (1981) study required only 80% of the children in the classes to be  within the designated age ranges, thus reducing the likelihood of differences  between settings. Only two studies were found that included children under 3  years of age (Brownell, 1990, Howes & Farver, 1987). The definition of  mixed-  age has varied widely across studies, with differences as little as 6 months  between older and younger children (Brownell, 1990) and as great as 3 years  (Howes & Farver, 1987). The outcomes assessed have varied widely across the  studies, measuring effects on domains such as overall social behavior, differenti-  ated levels of social play, pretend play, task performance, and task orientation.

For both 3- and 4-year-olds, social participation in mixed-age classes  differed from social participation in same-age classes.

Other studies, however, have found only weak associations between child- care structural quality and caregiving quality, or have failed to con fi rm these associations at all (Burchinal et al.,  2002 , Gialamas et al.,  2014 , Howes et al., 2008 , Pianta et al.,  2005 , Slot et al.,  2015 ).",number studi investig relat structur characterist process qualiti base assumpt childcar predict teacher provid care educ whether sensit reliabl emot avail child some evid posit caregiv more common when group size adult ratio smaller cryer tietz burchin leal palacio 1999 riksen walraven gever deynoot- fukkink 2015 nichd 2006 phillip et al 2000 burkhardt bossi perren 2019 train also found associ higher skill cli ff ord howe 2002 konto campbel milbourn 2005 lont 2007 2017 howev weak child- fail con fi rm all gialama 2014 2008 slot

While some childcare programmes favour a traditional grouping by age, other centres use mixed- age grouping that provides an extended age range within the same group. Such family-like programmes are highly  fl exible and require fewer sta ff , classrooms, and schedules. At the same time, mixed-age grouping may have consequences for both child engagement and the quality of caregiving.

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,4,"peer-group age compositions in the context of early education and childcare, since only a few countries (e.g., Germany, the Netherlands) adopt an extended age range and include children under the age of three in regular preschool classes (Helmerhorst et al.,  2015 , Sommer & Sechtig,  2016 ). Most previous studies comparing multi-age and same-age settings focused on children ’ s behavioural outcomes, while research on associations between peer-group age composition and caregiver behaviour is very limited. Overall, research provides evidence that caregiving in mixed-age groups is of lower quality (Tietze et al.,  2013 ). Sundell ( 1994 ) found that age range negatively in fl uenced the quality of interaction between preschool teachers and chil- dren. Teachers provided fewer teacher-guided activities and less elaborated instructions in groups with a wide age range. Sommer and Sechtig ( 2016 ) have shown that the extension of the age range in the group is a strong predictor of lower interaction quality between caregivers and children. To ally included the number of children aged under 36 months in the analysis and showed that the presence of even a single child younger than 36 months of age had a negative impact on the quality of caregiving (Sommer & Sechtig, 2016 ). This result is consistent with the  fi ndings of a Dutch study that investigated mixed-age groups comprising children aged from 0 to 4 years (de Schipper, Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts,  2007 ). The study indicated that the number of infants in the group is a signi fi cant predictor of caregiving quality: groups with fewer children aged under 24 months receive a better quality of care. A further study in a Dutch childcare context demonstrated that both caregivers ’  sensitive responsiveness and their educational skills were lower in infant groups (0 – 2 years) than in preschool groups (2 – 4 years) or even in mixed-age groups (0 – 4 years, Helmerhorst et al.,  2015 ). Some studies recog- nizing age composition as a potential determinant of caregiver behaviour in childcare centres reported that a higher mean age in the childcare group correlates with higher-quality caregiving behaviour (De Schipper, Marianne Riksen-Walraven, & Geurts,  2006 , Kuger & Kluczniok,  2009 ). To summarize, previous research provides some evidence that a wide age range, higher numbers of infants in the group, and a lower mean group age are all associated with lower caregiver-child interaction quality.",peer group age composit context earli educ childcar sinc few countri e.g. adopt extend rang includ child three regular preschool class helmerhorst et al 2015 sommer sechtig 2016 most previou studi compar multi set focus behaviour outcom while research associ caregiv limit overal provid evid mix lower qualiti tietz 2013 sundel 1994 found neg fl uenc interact teacher chil- dren fewer guid activ less elabor instruct wide shown extens strong predictor alli number 36 month analysi show presenc even singl younger than impact result consist fi nding dutch investig compris year de schipper riksen walraven geurt 2007 indic infant signi ca nt 24 receiv better care demonstr sensit respons skill some recog- nize potenti determin centr report higher mean correl mariann 2006 kuger kluczniok 2009 summar all

Additionally, childcare in Switzerland is characterized by a high degree of fl exibility in terms of children ’ s attendance schedules. Parents often work part-time and so choose the days of attendance depending on their individual job-related needs, which may also vary from week to week and from month to month. Thus, it is possible for individual children to attend childcare on single days (1 to 5 days a week), in the morning or afternoon, or for the whole day. The majority of children who attend childcare do so part-time for two or three days a week (Swiss Federal Statistical O ffi ce, 2014 ). The average group size is about 12 children, but a signi fi cant number of available childcare places are shared by two or more children (e.g., one child uses a childcare place on Monday morning, the other on Monday afternoon). The Swiss Childcare Association, which provides guidelines and standards on caregiving quality in childcare, takes children ’ s age and sta ff quali fi cations into account when calculating the caregiver-child ratio (Kibesuisse,  2016 ). The majority of professional caregivers in Swiss childcare have completed an apprenticeship of three years, which combines two-day school attendance and three-day in-service training per week. Caregivers trainees (i.e., young persons who attend a  fi rst year-long internship after completion of mandatory schooling) and apprentices work alongside qua- li fi ed professional caregivers (Perren et al.,  2017 , Stamm,  2009 ).",fi year start mandatori kindergarten link primari school addit childcar character high degre fl exibl term child attend schedul parent often work part time choos day depend individu job relat need may also vari week month thu possibl singl morn afternoon whole major two three swiss feder statist ffi ce 2014 averag group size 12 signi ca nt number avail place share more e.g. one us monday associ provid guidelin standard caregiv qualiti take age sta ff quali cation account when calcul ratio 2016 profession complet apprenticeship combin servic train per traine i.e. young person rst long internship after apprentic alongsid qua- li ed perren et al 2017 stamm 2009

Children with better behavioral skills are more equipped to meet the demands of the classroom environment, such as interacting successfully with peers and listening quietly while the teacher is talk- ing to the class. Accordingly, preschool behavioral skills have been found to relate to children ’ s adjust- ment to kindergarten, academic outcomes (Bulot- sky-Shearer & Fantuzzo, 2011, Denham et al., 2011), and peer success (Keane & Calkins, 2004).",abl behav appropri class- room also posit relat school outcom child better behavior skill more equip meet demand classroom environ interact success peer listen quietli while teacher talk- ing class accordingli preschool found adjust- ment kindergarten academ bulot- sky shearer fantuzzo 2011 denham et al kean calkin 2004

The Relation Between Classroom Age Composition and Children’s Language.pdf,4,"To accomplish these goals, this study used data from the Educare Implementation Study. Children receive early childhood education through Head Start in Educare programs at 23 schools across the United States (for a summary of sites see Educare Learning Network, 2016). Since all Educare sites participate in the Educare Implementation Study and children are evaluated annually, there are data available on a large sample of children from multi- ple classrooms. These data were used to explore this study ’ s three hypotheses: (a) Child age will moderate how classroom age composition relates to child outcomes, with younger children showing higher levels of skills in mixed age than in same age classrooms and older children showing higher levels of skills in same age than in mixed age",accomplish goal studi use data educar implement child receiv earli childhood educ head start program 23 school across summari site see learn network 2016 sinc all particip evalu annual avail larg sampl multi- ple classroom explor three hypothesi age moder composit relat outcom younger show higher level skill mix than older

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,1,"Social interaction and task behavior of preschool children in mixed-age (MA) and same-age (SA) groups were studied longitudinally in this natural experiment, which capitalized on one preschool’s transition from two SA (separate 3, 4) classrooms to two MA (combined 3/4) classrooms. In contrast to previous research examining MA and SA grouping, which has typically lacked appropriate comparison groups, the present study was essentially able to hold teachers, curriculum, location, teaching philosophy, and participant population constant. A total of 7887 naturalistic, time-sampled, classroom observations on 47 children attending the two classes were conducted over the course of 18 months. Children’s goal-directed activity, sustained attention, social affiliation, inappropriate behavior, and affect were reliably recorded using a checklist instrument. Significant age differences in behavior between the 3- and 4-year-olds in SA classrooms were typically eliminated in the context of MA classrooms such that the 3-year-olds in MA classes in several ways were more like 4-year-olds in SA classrooms, and 4-year-olds in MA classes behaved more like 3-year-olds in SA classrooms. The social and behavioral ecology of the MA preschool classrooms changed significantly over time as children became more familiar with one another. Several of the social affiliation advantages of MA grouping that were found (i.e., age and gender desegregation) wore off over time as the school year progressed. The effects of MA grouping on children’s social and behavioral development appear complicated.

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"Understanding similarities and differences between mixed-age (MA) and same-age (SA) peer interactions among young children is a worthwhile endeavor for both theoretical and practical reasons. In terms of theory, both Vygotsky’s and Piaget’s works suggest differential effects on children’s cognitive and social development for asymmetric (MA) as opposed to symmetric (SA) peer interactions (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliam, 1993, Hartup, 1983, Piaget, 1932, Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 1998, Vygotsky, 1930/1978). Interaction with SA peers (who are more likely to be equal in terms of knowledge, skill, and power) is thought to provide a unique context for children to engage in and resolve cognitive conflicts with others, thereby stimulating cognitive, social, and moral development (Azmitia, 1988, Piaget, 1932, Tudge, 1992). Interaction with older, more competent children is seen as an optimal context for facilitating cognitive and behavioral development according to Vygotskian and social learning/cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, Hartup, 1983, Vygotsky 1930–1935/1978). Interaction with younger children is thought to afford older children an opportunity to practice and develop prosocial, self-regulatory, and leadership skills (French, Waas, Stright, & Baker, 1986, Hartup, 1983, Katz, Evangelou, & Hartman, 1990, Messer, Joiner, Loveridge, Light, & Littleton, 1993, Winsler & Diaz, 1995), and, for older socially withdrawn children, an opportunity to facilitate social participation and social skills (Furman, Rahe, & Hartup, 1979, Hartup, 1983). It is important to note in this connection, however, that most of the research exploring the effects of age composition on children’s peer interactions has been conducted in laboratory or quasi-laboratory settings (e.g., placing children of various ages or ability levels together in the same room with a task and observing what happens). Less understood are the dynamics of SA and MA peer interactions that occur in naturalistic settings such as the early childhood classroom. childhood education (Katz et al., 1990, Lloyd, 1999). Advocates of MA grouping in early education claim that the MA classroom holds many social and cognitive advantages over SA classrooms by creating a richer and more diverse educational environment, minimizing normative pressures and competition, encouraging prosocial behavior, self-regulation, and social responsibility, increasing children’s tolerance for diversity, and decreasing gender segregation (Derscheid, 1997, Elkind, 1989, Goldman, 1981, Katz et al., 1990, Pratt, 1986, Roberts, Burchinal, & Bailey, 1994, Theilheimer, 1993, Whaley & Kantor, 1992). In MA groupings, because a wider range of child competencies is expected in the first place, the teacher is seen as better able to notice and respond to individual differences in children and provide for a more diverse and individually tailored set of experiences than is the case within",understand similar differ mix age sa peer interact among young child worthwhil endeavor theoret practic reason term theori vygotski ’s piaget work suggest differenti effect cognit social develop asymmetr oppos symmetr bailey burchin mcwilliam 1993 hartup 1983 1932 rubin bukowski parker 1998 1930/1978 more like equal knowledg skill power thought provid uniqu context engag resolv conflict other therebi stimul moral 1988 1992 older compet seen optim facilit behavior accord learn bandura 1986 1930–1935/1978 younger afford opportun prosoci self regulatori leadership french waa stright baker katz evangel hartman 1990 messer joiner loveridg light littleton winsler diaz 1995 withdrawn particip furman rahe 1979 import note connect howev most research explor composit conduct laboratori quasi set e.g. place variou abil level togeth room task observ happen less understood dynam occur naturalist earli childhood classroom educ et al lloyd 1999 advoc group claim hold mani advantag creat richer divers environ minim norm pressur competit encourag regul respons increas toler decreas gender segreg derscheid 1997 elkind 1989 goldman 1981 robert 1994 theilheim whaley kantor wider rang expect first teacher better abl notic respond individu tailor experi than case within
