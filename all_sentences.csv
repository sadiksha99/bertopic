Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,2,The interaction between behavior management (1 dimension of classroom quality) and classroom age composition was also significant indicating that a wider distribution of classroom age composition was positively related to children’s vocabulary gains within class- rooms characterized by better behavior management
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,2,Practice or Policy: Findings underscore the importance of childrens social interactions with more knowledgeable conversational partners in pro moting their vocabulary development and signify the need to help teachers learn how to manage chil dren’s behaviors soas to provide aclassroom thatis optimalfor child learning.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,2,"Vocabulary development is often a focus of applied developmental research addressing early childhood programming because of its central importance to children’s school readiness and later academic achievement (e.g., Justice, Mashburn, Pence, & Wiggins, 2008; Wasik, Bond, & Hindman, 2006)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,2,"In fact, preschool children’s vocabulary skills consistently predict later achievement in reading comprehension (Hindman, Skibbe, Miller, & Zimmerman, 2010; National Institute of Child Health and Human development Early Child Care Research Network, 2005; Storch & whitehurst 2002), and early delays in vocabulary development have correspondence regarding this article should be addressed to Ying Guo, School of Education, University of cincinnati 2610mcmickencir615 teacher hall cincinnati oh45221emailguoy3ucmailu cedu"

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"not surprisingly considerable attention has focused on ways to facilitate the early vocabulary development of preschool children from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds in order to mitigate the well documented achievement gap in the area of vocabulary (e.g., Neuman & Celano, 2001; Tabors, 1997; Wasik et al., 2006; Weizman & Snow, 2001; Wells, 1986)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"For instance, recent research has focused on the role that young children’s peers may play in facil- itating vocabulary development (e.g., Henry & Rickman, 2007; Mashburn, Justice, Downer, & Pianta, 2009)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"These investigations of peer effects within preschool classrooms show that the language skills of children’s classmates are a significant and unique predictor of language growth even beyond effects attributable to instructional quality mashburn etal2009 specifi cally higher peer language skills were positively related to childrens language outcomes during prekindergarten indicating that children may benefit from being in a classroom that, in the aggregate, contains older, more cognitively advanced children and that this is particularly true for children with lower language skills."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,Such findings suggest that classroom age composition may be an important consideration in understanding factors that influence childrens vocabulary development within early education settings as it provides information about peer characteristics in the classroom.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"For instance, if children’s vocabulary growth is facilitated through their interactions with peers, it may be important for younger children (e.g., 3 year olds to have opportunities to interact with older preschoolers as would occur in mixed-age classrooms that serve 3-, 4-, and 5 year olds"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"Presently, there is a great deal of variability in the age composition of preschool classrooms within the united states some classrooms referred to as same age classrooms enroll only chil dren within a particular age range; these typically enroll only 3 year olds or only 4 year olds"

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,"Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the extent to which classroom age composition operationalized based on variation in children’s chronological age is associated with childrens vocabulary development over an academic year in addressing this aim we examined the vocabulary gains of 130childrenenrolledin16 preschool classrooms which represented a subset of all children enrolled in these classrooms"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,Given that we did not have information on the ages of all children within the enrolled classrooms the study represents an exploratory examination of the way in which classroom age composition may influence children’s language growth.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,3,CLASSROOM AGE composition AND PRESCHOOL EDUCATION the use of mixed age classroom composition in the field of early childhood development has its roots in both social cognitive bandura1986rogers1987 tierney rogers 1989 and social
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"1018 guo tompkins justice pets cher cultural vygotsky 19301978 theories of learning and development from these perspectives interacting with older, more competent peers seems developmentally beneficial to children because it affords younger children the opportunity to engage in more challenging tasks and therefore experience greater cognitive growth than children without such opportunities"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,At the same time it affords older children in such settings the opportunity to scaffold younger children which may also provide benefits.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"For instance, younger children can enrich their learning by observing, emulating, and imitating the behaviors of older children (Bandura, 1986), whereas older children can practice prosocial behaviors der scheid 1997; Urberg & Kaplan, 1986) and leadership skills as they serve as mentors for young children by providing support and guid ance (Wertsch, 1985)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"In short, mixed-age classrooms provide children with the opportunity to form relations with a wider variety of children compared with their counterparts in same-age classrooms"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,Whaley and Kantor (1992) explicitly discussed the positive advantages of mixed infant toddler classrooms arguing that such classrooms provide children with a ‘‘family’’ and collaborative atmosphere
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,These researchers also suggested that mixed-age classrooms might help to minimize competitive pressure in terms of academic development by making parents more focused on their children’s individual development which thereby decreases the competition among peers in the classroom.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"There are some arguments opposed to mixed-age classrooms that favor restricting the range of ages within preschool classrooms for instance in a recent study examining childrens learn ing within mixed- and same-age classrooms Moller, forbes jones and Hightower (2008) asserted that same-age classrooms allow teachers to targeta specific age group in their curricu- lum which allows them to focus on what is developmentally appropriate for that age group and thus may lead to better classroom quality."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,These researchers showed that preschoolers who are closer inagemore closely resemble one another in terms of their skill and knowledge develop- ment.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"In addition, contrary to Whaley and Kantor’s (1992) assertion that older children nurture younger children in mixed age classrooms goldman and chail le 1984 found no evidence that older children engage in more nurturance or mentoring in mixed-age (3- to 5 year old groups compared to same-age groups."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"In general, it is somewhat unclear as to whether preschool age children benefit from being in mixed versus same-age classrooms and if there is an advantage to either, whether this advantage extends to both older and younger children within the setting."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"CLASSROOM AGE composition AND LANGUAGE development although there is a lack of congruence in findings among the available research on the effects of classroom age composition on child learning, researchers have considered how classroom age composition may be associated with preschoolers language skills indirectly by examining chil dren’s communicative interactions with peers in mixed- and same-age programs."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"For example, Winsler et al."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,(2002) compared children attending two same-age university based classrooms (either 3 year olds or 4 year olds with children attending the same university based preschool the following year when the preschool adopted a mixed age classroom model 3to4 year olds
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,4,"The researchers found that in the same-age classrooms 4 year olds tended to spend more time interacting with other children (as opposed to spending time alone) when given the choice compared to 3 year olds however, age differences in peer interaction were not found in the"

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,The results of this study would seem to suggest that children may prefer to interact with their same-age peers even when placed in mixed-age classrooms
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"In contrast, Derscheid (1997) examined children in mixed-age (2- to 4 year old university based child care programs and found that the longer 4 year olds spent in a mixed age childcare program the more frequently they spoke to a2 year old peer with whom they were matched in forced pairings the author concluded that mixed age preschool settings can facilitate childrens social development which in turn increases the talk between older and younger children."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,One limitation of this study however is that this was a forced pairing rather than a naturalistic obser vation of classroom dynamics.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"It is interesting to note that the available research presents con- flict ed findings regarding the experiences of children in mixed and same age classroom settings moreover, it is difficult to extrapolate from such work how classroom age composition might influence children’s language development over time."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"It is possible, for instance, to speculate based on the Winsler et al."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"(2002) findings that variation in classroom age composition (i.e., being in a mixed- vs. same-age classroom) would have little impact on children’s language growth if, in either setting, children tend to interact with same-age peers."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"Studies that look specifically at children’s achievement over time within mixed- and same- age classrooms provide the most direct route for understanding whether classroom age compo- sition affects development there are a dearth of studies of this nature, however."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,A recent exception is research by moller et al

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"Classrooms were not differentiated in terms of same age or mixed age, although the average age span within classrooms in this sample was 18 months these research ers sought to determine whether variation among classrooms in terms of children sage was asso ciated with achievement over an academic year."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"The measure of achievement utilized was the Child observation Record, which includes three factors: Cognitive Skills, Social engagement and coordinated movement motor Skills."

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,What is interesting is that Moller et al.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,reported that when they controlled for children’s age and gender a wider range and standard deviations din preschool children sages within preschool classrooms was negatively related to children’s scores over time on the Child Obser- vation Record.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"The authors therefore contended that mixed-age preschool classrooms may not benefit children’s development particularly in the area of language development however, a limitation of this study is that children’s language skills were not directly examined."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"Bell, greenfield and bu lot sky shearer (2013) replicated and enhanced the methodological approach used by Moller et al."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"They found that classroom age composition was not associated with low income preschool children s growth in multiple domains of school readiness including lan guage and literacy early math social and emotional skills and approaches to learning similar to Moller et al., this research also used an indirect measure, with children’s skills rated by their teachers."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,"In fact, teacher ratings of children may be affected by the variability of the children within the classroom and teachers characteristics and perspectives m ashburnham red owner & Pianta, 2006)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,5,consequently an important impetus for the present study was to determine whether the findings of Moller et al.

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"1020 guo tompkins justice pets cher development would be replicated using a well validated direct measure of vocabulary skill, given that few studies have directly examined how classroom age composition relates to language development specifically"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,Some researchers have extended these conflicting findings and reported that the effect of mixed-age groups may differentially affect younger versus older children.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"specifically mixed- age groups may benefit younger children yet have no effect or even a negative effect on older children (e.g., Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliam, 1993; Dunn, Kontos, & Potter, 1996; Winsler et al., 2002)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"To this point, Justice, Petscher, s chat schneider and Mashburn (2011) recently emphasized the importance of considering a child’s reference status that is, his or her skills in relation to those of his or her classmates in understanding how classroom composition may be influential to children’s growth in language skills."

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,THE MODERATING ROLE OF CLASSROOM QUALITY considering the previously addressed mixed results regarding the way in which classroom age composition may promote young children’s development it is important to examine other fac- tors that may moderate these relations and may partially account for some of the incongruent findings in the literature
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"For example, Bell et al."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,(2013) suggested that it would be important to include more classroom factors eg social environment structure of the classroom in analy ses to better understand the role of classroom age composition
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"In particular classroom quality (i.e., dynamics of teacher child interactions is an important factor that may moderate the relationship between classroom age composition and preschoolers language development"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"Wilkinson and Fung (2002) also suggested that to properly evaluate the compositional effects of classrooms and their impacts on children’s learning, it is necessary to examine the group or class composition in relation to classroom quality and children’s learning outcomes."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"classroom quality refers to how teachers interact with students on a daily basis and includes three broad domains emotional support instructional support and classroom organization eg piantahamre2009piantalap arohamre2008 emotional support describes teachers abilities to support children’s social and emotional functioning however, instructional support encompasses teachers’ use of classroom activities to support children’s cognitive and language skills (Pianta et al., 2008)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"Classroom organization describes how teachers effectively organize and manage children’s behavior, time, and attention in the classroom (Emmer & Stough, 2001; Pianta et al., 2008)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,6,"Within each of these three major domains is a set of more specific dimen- sions of classroom interactions that likely contribute to childrens academic and social outcomes (Pianta & Hamre, 2009; Pianta et al., 2008)."

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,7,"Instead, a well managed classroom may provide a supportive context for peer interaction and children’s language learning to occur."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,7,specifically within well managed classrooms teachers may com- municate behavioral expectations to children monitor the classroom effectively to prevent prob lems before they occur and use effective strategies to redirect misbehavior s thus there are few oppositional behaviors piantaetal2008 consequently instructional time may be maximized so that children have more opportunities to talk with teachers and children which facilitates their language learning.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,7,"Moreover, one recent study reported that preschool teachers’ behavior man- agement significantly predicted preschool children’s early language and literacy skills (Dobbs- Oates, Kaderavek, Guo, & Justice, 2011)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,7,collectively these findings indicate that effective behavior management may promote peer interactions and also be related to childrens language learning it is logical to hypothesize that the same degree of age mixing may manifest itself dif ferently based on the level of teachers’ behavior management

Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,14,Wediscuss eachof these findings more thoroughly inturn.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,14,The first major finding of the present work is that the effects of classroom age composition were dependent on childrens age specifically younger children were perhaps positively influ enced by a wider distribution of classroom chronological ages.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,14,"By contrast, older children did not show any language gain when enrolled in classrooms with a greater range in chronological age versus a lesser range this finding is consistent with previous research examining the influ ence of classroom age composition in classrooms serving low-income children (Bell et al.,"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,classroom age composition 1029 2013).
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"suggesting that for younger children, classroom composition appears to be an important consideration in anticipating vocabulary growth over an academic year (Justice et al., 2011; mashburn etal2009 moreover we found that vocabulary gains were greater for younger chil dren than older children, consistent with a prior study showing that Head Start children’s cog- nitive growth (including a vocabulary measure) was greater in 3 year olds than 4 year olds puma bellcookheidlopez2005"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,we speculate that the classroom with a wider distri bution of children’s ages provided benefits to younger children as a result of the greater gains that they made.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,This finding has both relevance to theories of children’s learning within early education set- tings as well as practical implications concerning classroom age composition in the preschool setting.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"Concerning the former, the significant interaction between child age and classroom age composition supports the theoretical assumption that interaction with more able peers results in optimal learning for younger children (Vygotsky, 19301978"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"One might presume that in day today interactions with more capable peers the language development of younger children is scaffolded by the peers with whom they are interacting with in classrooms in which children are relatively heterogeneous in age such opportunities are readily available given that children in preschool classrooms spend a significant portion of their day interacting with peers during free-play activities (Early et al., 2010)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"However, within classrooms in which children are relatively homogenous in terms of age, such opportunities may not be available."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"In short, the positive effects of the classroom with a wider distribution of children’s ages on younger chil- dren’s vocabulary development provides support to social interaction ist theories of language development which highlight the importance of childrens social interactions with more knowl edgeable conversational partners in promoting language skills (e.g., Bruner, 1983; Justice & Ezell, 1999)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"Concerning the practical implications of these findings, we might suggest that preschool classrooms should provide more opportunities for children to interact with more advanced peers which may positively influence their vocabulary skills."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,For these children in particular namely those youngsters the present results also raise real questions about the benefits of homogenous groupings of pupils within classroom settings: Younger children who were in classrooms char- acterized by a high range in age exhibited significantly larger vocabulary growth compared to younger children in classrooms with a narrow range.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"Although these findings cannot be inter- preted causally, they do point to the need for preschool programs to carefully consider their grouping practices and ensure that younger children have the opportunity to interact with and learn from more capable peers in addition preschool programs may need to pay particular atten tion to the experiences of more capable children in the mixed-age group, given the lack of vocabulary gains for older children for example teachers may allocate additional time to work ing more intensively on specific language skills with more advanced children."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,Asecond finding of this work and one that extends the available research on classroom age composition within preschool settings is that classroom quality significantly moderated there la tions between classroom age (SD) composition and children’s gains in vocabulary
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,15,"The current study found that a wider distribution of age was positively related to childrens vocabulary gains when classrooms provided high quality behavior management it is important to note that class rooms with more homogeneous age groups score lower on vocabulary skills when the quality of behavior management is high, which is slightly contrary to our first finding indicating that the benefits to younger children become more pronounced as the classroom age range increases our"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,"1030 guo tompkins justice pets cher data did not allow us to explain this dynamic mechanism at play, so future research should examine how the three way interactions among child age classroom age composition and beha vi or management predict childrens language skills despite the unexpected inconsistency these findings are particularly important, suggesting that high quality teaching (behavior manage- ment when applied within classrooms with a wider range of childrens ages may offer special benefit to children’s vocabulary growth."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,"high quality behavior management was operationally defined in the present study as one in which teachers provide clear and consistent behavior expectations monitor behavior, and use effective strategies to prevent and redirect misbehavior s (CLASS; Pianta et al., 2008)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,"In fact, preschool teachers’ behavior management is a key teaching skill and has been linked to child behavior and literacy learning, such that positive behavior management strategies were related to less child severe misbehavior (Kim, Stormont, & Espinosa, 2009) and more gains in chil- dren’s language and literacy skills dobbs oates et al., 2011)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,Recent work by Mashburn et al.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,2009 has suggested that well managed classrooms moderate the association between peer lan guage skills and preschoolers expressive language skills within well managed classrooms chil dren’s language learning may be well organized to ensure an optimal amount of time in classroom instruction
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,Our findings further support these previous studies and underscore the importance of behavior management in the context of classrooms with a wider range of children’s ages.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,these findings may have important practical implications for researchers educators and pol icymakers.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,Before discussing these we must emphasize that this study focused exclusively on children’s vocabulary development and did not address other key areas of development
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,"Thus, the findings must be interpreted in this vein and replication with other domains of development should be pursued in addition as described previously the subsample 710among16 children enrolled in each classroom) selected for this study may nothave accurately represented the age mix of classrooms thus limiting the significance for practical implications in regard to the mixed-age classrooms"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,nonetheless we do offer fresh insight into questions concerning how to make the mixed-age classroom a supportive context as suggested by this exploratory work.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,"It may be difficult for older children in particular to reap the benefits of mixed-age classrooms because of the challenges their teachers face within such contexts, such as ‘‘lack of time for teaching the required content, a greater workload, and lack of time for individual attention and remediation (Veenman, 1995, p. 324)."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,Some experts have proposed that effective class- room instruction within mixed-age classrooms may need to look different from traditional con- ceptual izations of instruction for same-age classrooms and our findings suggest that this proposal may have merit.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,"As Hattie (2002) suggested, teachers likely need to use differential teaching methods when they switch from mixed-age classrooms to restricted age classrooms or vice versa thus we suggest that providing teachers with professional development targeted specifically at how toteach in mixed age classrooms might be one way to increase the positive benefits of mixed-age classrooms on children’s vocabulary development"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,Through professional development teachers may learn how to couple high quality teaching with curriculum differen tiations suited to mixed-age teaching.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,16,"Such professional development can also help teachers to cope with the challenges that may occur in leading mixed-age classrooms which may promote teachers’ sense of self efficacy in working with children who may vary substantially inage.Of particular import, from our perspective is helping teachers learn how to manage children’s behaviors so as to provide a classroom that is optimal for child learning."
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,17,classroom age composition 1031 limitations and Future Studies In conclusion the present research explored the relations among classroom age composition classroom quality and childrens vocabulary development over an academic year findings sug gest that classroom age composition may be associated with childrens vocabulary development
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,17,This work underscores the importance of future research that pursues more rigorously the possible consequences of classroom age composition on preschoolers learning and educators’ teaching within early childhood this is important because of the limitations of the present work
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,17,first the results of the current study are correlational thus we can not assume that the relation ship observed between classroom age composition and childrens vocabulary development is causal in nature experimental and longitudinal research is needed to determine whether mixed age class rooms have definitive effects on preschool children s gains in vocabulary second data from only 7 to 10 children were collected within each of the classrooms enrolled in the present study as a result the subsample selected for the study may not have accurately reflected the population of children enrolled in each classroom thus the findings obtained from this exploratory study need to be inter preted with caution clearly a more reliable estimate of classroom age composition would need to include all children in the classroom future studies should replicate these findings using a more pre cise measure of classroom age composition
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,17,"Third, this study examined the complex relationship between classroom composition and children’s vocabulary growth (measuring change between two time points however the change between two time points can not fully represent an individual childs academic growth over time as moller et al"
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,17,2008 proposed one future direction could be to examine the effects of classroom composition on childrens development across multiple time points at least three timepoints the use of multiple time points would permit exploration into the possi bility of both linear and nonlinear academic trajectories fourth because of the limited sample size of this study 130childrenin16 classrooms we examined how one dimension of classroom quality namely behavior management moderated the relations between classroom age composition and chil dren s vocabulary outcomes given that classroom quality is complex and multifaceted future work should use a larger sample size to examine the other dimensions of classroom quality in combination with classroom age composition that may contribute to child learning finally the present study only included children in publicly funded preschool classrooms serving at-risk children.
Classroom Age Composition and Vocabulary Development Among At-Risk Preschoolers.pdf,17,"Thus, it is not clear whether these findings can be generalized to other settings such as programs serving children from different demographic backgrounds or children with special needs research efforts designed to study the effects of classroom age composition on a more general population of children is an impor tant future line of inquiry"

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,3,(p. 16) The current multi-age classroom movement necessitates the explora- tion of the zone of proximal development within the natural learning dy- namics of mixed-age interactions and collaboration

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,3,Stone and Christie (1996) examined the literacy activity in a multi-age (K-2) classroom and found that 33% of the collaborative literacy exchanges involved same-grade peers and 24% involved younger children helping older classmates

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"In addition to the need to examine the zone of proximal development in multi-age classroom contexts, there is also a need to identify the ways in which mixed-age groups of children construct collaborative contexts that create the zone."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,Previous research has given insufficient attention to the JLR types of collaboration that children use to support each other's learning.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,Christie & Attention has focused on the products of collaboration rather than the Stone process of collaboration
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,The present study examined the collaborative reading and writing in- teractions that occurred in a literacy enriched play center during 2 years.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"In the first year, the classroom was organized as a multi-age classroom with a mix of kindergartners first graders, and second graders."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"The second year, the classroom was a traditional same-age kindergarten with 5-year-old stu- dents."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"The teacher, room arrangement and materials in the play center all remained the same."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"Thus, the physical setting remained constant, but an important element of social environment - the age range of children in- teracting in the play setting - changed."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"Our study had two purposes, both of which are connected to the con- cept of the zone of proximal development"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,The first purpose was to exam- ine the amount and types of collaborative literacy interactions that oc- curred in the play center under the two grouping arrangements
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"Supporters of multi-age grouping, citing the zone, claim that the broader the age of children in a classroom, the greater the opportunity for collaborative learn- ing."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"However, there is scant evidence to back up this claim."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"If the multi- age advocates are correct, we should find a larger amount, and perhaps a broader range, of collaborative literacy interactions occurring in multi- age class than in the same-age kindergarten"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,Our second purpose was to examine the directionality of collaborative literacy exchanges.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,The zone concept assumes that collaboration is unidirectional with older or more competent children always helping younger or less competent peers.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"We wanted to learn if collaborative exchanges are actually this simple, or if other more complex patterns of interaction would emerge when these ex- changes are closely examined."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,Method The study took place in one teacher's classroom across a 2-year period.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"During the first year, the teacher taught a multi-age K-2 class."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"It was in- tended that the kindergarten children would stay with the teacher through the end of second grade, keeping in line with the common definition of a multi-age classroom - a mixed-age grouping of children that stay with the same teacher for several years."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,4,"The next year, however, the teacher was as- signed to a whole-day kindergarten because of school restructuring"

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,5,Setting J LR We selected the teacher and classroom because one of us had taught at the collaborative school and knew that this teacher had a social interaction ist perspective Literacy and placed heavy importance on play as a context for learning.

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,6,"Data Collection During the first year, we videotaped 15 hours of activity in the play center of the multi-age class."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,6,"During the second year, we videotaped 15 hours of activity in the same play center while it was being used by children in the same-age kindergarten"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,6,"In both years, the videotaping occurred during a 4-week period during April and May."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,6,We waited until the school year was almost over so that the children would have time to get to know each other well and form a classroom community.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,6,"Starting the first week in April, the teacher videotaped every day that there was an uninterrupted 45- to 60-minute period for children to use the learning centers."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,6,Because of special end of the year activities several days were skipped during both years of the study.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,6,The teacher turned the camcorder on at the beginning of the period and turned it off at the end of the period.

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,The teacher intervened in the play only if there was a significant disruption (which was a rare occurrence
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,The play that took place in this center was entirely the result of the children's interactions with each other and with the play setting.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,Data Analysis The data were analyzed in two separate phases.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"The multi-age videotapes were transcribed and analyzed immediately following the first year of the study (Stone & Christie, 1996)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,We analyzed the data from the same-age kindergarten 1 year later.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"Each year, after the videotaping was completed, we made a detailed tran- script of the action and dialogue that occurred in the play center during each session."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,Bogdan and Biklin (1992) have recommended this type of self transcription so that researchers become very familiar with their data.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,We organized the transcripts into play groups - different groupings of chil- dren who chose to play in the play center.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"On some days, one group of children would remain in the play center for the entire center time."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"On other occasions, two or three completely different groups would play in the center during the period."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"The multi-age transcript was divided into 41 play groups, compared with 3 8 play groups for the same-age kindergarten"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"The completed transcripts were quite lengthy: 477 typed pages of transcript for the multi-age classroom, and 577 pages for the same-age kindergarten"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"During the first year, we used a combined inductive and deductive ap- proach to code the literacy incidents and collaboration that occurred in the play center (Miles & Huberman, 1984)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"For purposes of this study, we defined literacy activity as any activity involving reading, writing, or inter- action with print items (books, newspapers signs, etc."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"), and collaboration as any attempt by a child to help a peer engage in a literacy activity."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,"We began by independently examining the transcript for the first 10 play groups, using a constant comparison procedure (Glaser & Strauss, 1979) to develop categories for the literacy activities and collaboration that oc- curred."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,Once the categories were established we used these categories to code deductively the collaborative literacy activities of the remaining 31 play groups.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,The coding was done jointly by the two principal investiga- tors.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,We simultaneously viewed the videotapes and read over the transcripts
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,7,115
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,We independently coded the activity and then compared our coding.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"In cases when initial codings were not identical, we reexamined the transcripts and watched video segment again in order to reach consensus."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"On several occasions, we encountered behaviors that did not fit our existing codes, J L R and new codes were added."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,Christie & We ended up with ten categories of literacy activity for the multi-age Stone group: 1.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"environmental print reading: attempting to determine the meaning of contextualized print (e.g., labels on product containers 2."

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"Reading aloud: reading to another person, doll, stuffed animal or imaginary playmate 6."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"Reading extension: engaging in a book related activity (e.g., art, drama, game) 7."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"Academic reading: practicing reading skills (e. g., practicing recog- nizing the letters of the alphabet) 8."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"Functional writing: writing in order to get things done (e.g., invita- tions to a birthday party) 9."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,recreational writing: writing for pleasure or self expression 10.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,"Academic writing: practicing handwriting spelling, or other writ- ing related skill The social context of literacy activity was coded using three categories (a) solitary, the literacy activity occurs independent of other children; (b) parallel, two or more children engage in the same literacy activity in the play center but they do not interact with each other; and (c) collaboration children interact together in connection with a literacy activity."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,collaboration was subdivided into five categories of helping behavior: 1.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,Modeling: demonstrating how to do a literacy activity while peers are nearby and in a position to watch 2.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,8,Inviting: asking peers to join in a literacy activity 3.

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,"One year later, we used the codes developed in the first phase of the project to analyze deductively the literacy activity and collaboration of the J L R same-age kindergarten group."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,"We found that we needed to add one more collaborative category of literacy activity: Literacy Playful assimilation s ignoring the real uses of literacy items and as- signing them play related identities or functions (e.g., using books as if they were building blocks) reexamination of the multi-age transcripts revealed three examples of play- ful assimilation s"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,"Next, we examined the data from the coding sheets of both groups to identify representative examples of each type of literacy activity and col- laborative interactions that occurred in the multi-age and same-age groups."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,"In addition, we searched for patterns in the directionality of collaborative interactions"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,"In response to suggestions from reviewers of earlier versions of this re- port, we subjected the data to several other forms of analysis."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,The tran- scripts and videos were reanalyzed by two research assistants in order to determine the percentage of literacy activities in each grouping arrange- ment that was connected with ongoing dramatic play episodes.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,The re- search assistants also checked the accuracy of the codings on the initial analysis sheets.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,Two mistakes were discovered and corrected.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,"Finally, we had already obtained frequency counts of the different types of literacy activities and collaborative interactions that occurred in the multi-age and same-age classes."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,"However, we had no information about the amount of time that each group spent engaging in these activities"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,To obtain this information we viewed the tapes once more and timed the duration of each literacy activity.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,Findings Our findings focus on three aspects of the children's behavior in the lit- eracy enriched play center: literacy activities collaboration and the back- and-forth flow between experts and novices.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,9,Literacy Activities Our analyses revealed that children in the multi-age class engaged in a larger amount and wider variety of literacy activity in the play center than did 117
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,the same-age kindergarten group (see Table 1).
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,The multi-age group en- gaged in more than twice as many literacy activities than the same-age group.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,We were surprised by the sheer amount of literacy exhibited by the multi-age group.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,They spent more than one third of their time in the play JLR center (5 hours out of a total of 15 hours) engaging in some form of read- Christie & ing and writing.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,Stone We examined the types of literacy activities in which the two groups engaged and the duration of these activities

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,The two groups exhibited different patterns of literacy activity in the play center.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,Browsing was the most common literacy activity among the same-age kindergarten group.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,Browsing through books occurred both during the midst of dramatic play and during lulls in play activities
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,"For example, Cassie paused, while making a series of pretend telephone calls, to glance through a book that caught her attention."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,"Francis, who had difficulty interacting with other children, tended to use browsing as a way to keep occupied while she watched her peers play."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,"The same-age kindergartners also engaged in more playful assimila- tions than the multi-age group, ignoring the real uses of literacy materials and using them for play related purposes."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,"In one amusing episode, Justine picked up an ""alphabet"" ice tray that contained 26 cube molds, each with a raised letter of the alphabet at the bottom, and pretended to shake letters out of the ice tray into a soup pot."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,She then told a co-player that she had just made alphabet soup.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,"As one would predict from research on emergent literacy (e.g., Teale, 1982), the same-age kindergartners also engaged in functional forms of reading and writing."

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,The children in the multi-age class engaged in a wider range of literacy activity than the same-age group.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,"Like the same-age group, they engaged in large amounts of functional reading and writing (three times as much as the other group)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,"However, the multi-age group also engaged in consid- erable amounts of reading aloud, recreational reading and writing, and academic reading and writing - activities that did not occur very often, if at all, in the same-age kindergarten class."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,10,Reading aloud was often connected with the multi-age group's play themes.

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,A large majority of both groups' literacy activity was related to the JLR children's ongoing dramatic play episodes: 67% in same-age kindergarten Christie & and 71% in the multi-age class.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"In both groups, much of the functional Stone reading (e.g., reading cookbooks while pretending to bake food), func- tional writing (e.g., jotting down shopping lists), and reading aloud (e.g., reading books to dolls) activity was connected with play themes."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,It is interesting to note that kindergartners were present in 37 out of the 41 play groups in the multi-age class (see Table 2).
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"Seventy percent of play groups in which the kindergartners participated also contained first graders, and 78% involved second graders."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"Thus, many opportunities existed for the kindergartner to witness the literacy activities of their older classmates"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,Duration of literacy activities
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,Table 1 reveals that the multi-age group's literacy activities lasted longer than those of the same-age kindergartners but the difference was not very large.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"The mean duration for the multi-age group's activities was about 2 minutes, compared with \Vi minutes for the same-age group."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"Thus, the two groups tended to differ more in the fre- quency of different categories of literacy activity rather than in the dura- tion of these activities"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,predictably the multi-age group's writing activities and reading aloud sessions were longer than those of the same-age group.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,One would expect that the advanced literacy skills of the first and second graders in the multi- age class would allow them to sustain these activities longer than younger students.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"In addition, the multi-age group's playful assimilation s were much more sustained than the same-grade kindergartners play episodes."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,This finding agrees with Perlmutter and Burrell's (1995) contention that the play of primary grade children is more focused and sustained than that of younger children.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"Although same-age kindergartners engaged in a much smaller number of recreational reading episodes than the multi-age group, the same-age kindergartners episodes lasted almost twice as long as those of the other group."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,This surprising finding may reflect different functions of recreational reading at different ages.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"When we examined the recreational reading epi- sodes in the multi-age class by grade level, we discovered that the mean duration of multi-age kindergartners recreational reading was 3 minutes and 15 seconds, compared with a mean duration of 1 minute and 50 sec- onds for the first and second graders."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,12,"The kindergartners in both class- rooms appeared to get deeply involved in their books, whereas the older children in the multi-age class tended to use recreational reading as a way to pass the time during lulls in dramatic play."

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,Perhaps the more intense engage- ment by the kindergartners is related to the fact that reading is a newly acquired skill for these children.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,Comparing kindergartners in the two classrooms
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,Many of the above find- ings may simply reflect the fact that the multi-age group contained vj first and second graders.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,One would expect that frequency and duration of the literacy activities of these older students would be higher than those of the same-grade kindergartners
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,But what about the kindergartners in multi- age classroom?
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,How did their literacy behavior compare with their coun- terparts in the same-age kindergarten
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,Table 3 compares the frequency of the literacy behaviors of the kinder- gartners in the two classrooms
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,13,"Two frequencies are reported for the kin- der gartner s in the multi-age class: the actual frequencies and the weighted frequencies which compensate for the fact that the play groups in the multi- age classroom had, on average, one third the number of kindergartners contained in the same-grade kindergarten play groups.1 1 The mean num- Although the actual frequencies reveal a slight advantage for the same- ber of kinder gart grade kindergartners the weighted frequencies indicate that the kinder- ners in the multi- age play groups gartners in the multi-age class engaged in almost three times as much lit- was 1.5 .compared eracy activity as their same-grade counterparts"

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,15,"Three forms of collaboration that were rarely, if ever, used in the same- age group were used frequently in the multi-age class: assisting, tutoring, and directing."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,15,Assisting was the most frequently used of the three.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,15,In this type of collaboration one child would help another do a reading or writ- ing activity.

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,16,We were interested in investigating the assumption 124
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,17,"that collaborative learning is unidirectional with older, more competent children always helping younger, less competent peers."

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,18,"We also found that collaborative interactions sometimes had a sequen- tial effect, with the child receiving assistance later helping another peer engage in a similar activity."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,18,"In the multi-age class, Ginger (Grade 2) and Joe (Grade 1) were pretending to be parents preparing dinner."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,18,"Ginger mod- eled the functional reading of a recipe book for Joe, engaging Joe in read- ing the book."

Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,18,Although these sequences were more common in the multi-age class (11 incidents we also observed 4 instances in the same- age group.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,18,Discussion We found that kindergartners in the multi-age class were exposed to a larger amount and broader range of literacy activities in the socio dramatic play center than were their counterparts in the same-age kindergarten class.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,18,The multi age group kindergartners also engaged in proportionately more literacy activity than the kindergartners in the same-age class.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,18,"In addition, children in the multi-age classroom engaged in more collaboration con- nected with literacy and used a broader range of strategies to help their 126"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,classmates do reading and writing activities
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,These findings suggest that multi-age grouping presents children with more opportunities to learn about literacy from their peers in print enriched play settings than does traditional same-age grouping.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,We also found that the ways in which children collaborate were more J L R diverse than common interpretations of the zone of proximal development collaborative would lead one to believe.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"These interpretations of the zone concept are Literacy based on the assumption that collaborative peer interactions are unidirec- tional, with ""experts"" (children who are older or more capable) helping ""novices"" (younger or less able children)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"We found many examples of this type of expert to novice helping activity, but we also discovered other patterns."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,More than half the collaborative exchanges in the multi-age group involved same-grade collaboration or younger children helping older class- mates.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"In addition, many of the collaborative interactions in both groups were multidirectional in nature."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,Children who received help from a peer would reciprocate by providing assistance to that same peer or another peer.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"Thus the expert and novice roles were not firmly set; instead, these roles appeared to flow back and forth between children."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"These findings in no way refute the zone of proximal development concept, but they do sug- gest collaborative learning is more complex than suggested by this popu- lar concept."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"Vygotsky (1978) suggested that ""an essential feature of learning is that it creates the zone of proximal development that is, learning awakens a variety of developmental processes that are able to operate only when the child is interacting with people in his environment and in collaboration with his peers"" (p. 90)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"The zone then is not a clear-cut space that exists independent of the process; rather, it is created in the course of social learn- ing (Tudge & winter hoff 19 9 3)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,We found that the mixed-age play groupings created a natural context for adjusting the zone to the needs of each child.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"As each child's literacy needs and strengths vary, so does the directionality of the zone."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"Tudge and winter hoffi993 in their work with expert nov ice dyads, also found that the relationship of partners in the zone was clearly not unidirectional both partners changed in the course of interaction gaining new understandings through collaboration"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"Further research is needed to determine if multi-age grouping has simi- lar effects on literacy and collaboration in other classroom settings, such as the library center or in structured cooperative learning groups."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,"In addition, longitudinal studies need to be conducted to determine if the opportuni- ties provided by peer collaboration have a significant impact on actual lit- eracy learning."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,19,Previous research has shown that print enriched play centers are very effective in eliciting literacy activity at the preschool and kindergarten levels 127
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"(Christie & Enz, 1992; Kantor, Miller, & Fernie, 1992; Morrow & Rand, 1991; Neuman & Roskos, 1992,1997; Vukelich, 1991)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,Our study showed that these centers also have potential benefits at the primary grade level when combined with multi-age grouping.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,Further research is needed to JLR investigate the types of collaborative literacy engaged in by children in Christie & same-age primary classes.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,Perhaps these play settings are beneficial for Stone children from preschool through the primary grades under any grouping arrangement
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"The timing of the observations which took place during April and May, may have contributed to the large amount of collaborative interaction in both groups."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,The children had approximately 7 months to establish com- munity and to learn to work together.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,It would be interesting to study the collaborative interactions that occur in similar groups during the first sev- eral months of the school year.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,The children in this study came from very diverse cultural backgrounds
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"A basic assumption of the print enriched play center strategy is that the play settings should resemble the literacy environments children encoun- ter at home and in their communities (Christie, 1994)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"Research has dem- onstrated that there is considerable variation in these environments among different cultural groups (Heath, 1982; purcell gates 1995)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"literacy play advocates therefore recommend that teachers make an effort to stock print- enriched play setting with literacy artifacts from children's homes and neighborhoods (Roskos, Vukelich, Christie, Enz, & Neuman, 1995)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,We did not detect any effort to do this in the play center that we observed.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"The setting, which was set up as a generic housekeeping center, contained books, food containers newspaper, pencils, pens, and blank pieces of paper."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,We were somewhat surprised that the setting was so effective in eliciting lit- eracy from these diverse children.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,Perhaps the setting and materials were so generic that they were familiar to all the children.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,Research is needed to investigate the effects of cultural relevancy on children's behavior in print- enriched play settings.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,The gender valence of play settings also deserves future study.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,The housekeeping center with its kitchen appliances and cooking props was definitely more attractive to girls than to boys.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"Research has shown boys spend more time playing in centers with non domestic themes - airport, pizza parlor, doctor's office - than in housekeeping centers (Dodge & Frost, 1986; Howe, Moller, Chambers, & Petrakos, 1993)."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,"It would be interesting to repeat the present study using different play themes and then examine patterns of gender participation literacy activity, and collaboration"
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,In conclusion the children in both classes used the print enriched play as a context for collaborative literacy activity.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,20,The multi-age arrangement 128
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,21,"resulted in ""more of a good thing."""
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,21,The combination of a print enriched play environment and broader age range of children facilitated a large amount and diverse variety of literacy behaviors from children at all three grade levels.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,21,"In addition, more collaboration occurred in the multi-age set- ting."
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,21,We also found that the collaborative learning that occurred in both J L R grouping arrangements was quite complex and multidirectional with collaborative children constantly changing expert and novice roles.
Collaborative literacy activity in print-enriched play center exploring the zone in same age and multi age goruping.pdf,21,This suggests that Literacy opportunities for peer collaboration may have benefits for all children in a classroom.

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Support for Mixed-Age Classrooms Vygotsky (1978) proposed that children in mixed-aged groups gain social skills during the process of scaffolding in which a more competent individual supports the learning process of a less competent one, through social interactions and modeling."

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,Studies have also found several advantages for older children in mixed-age classrooms
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"For example, Hercheid (1997) found that interacting with younger children resulted in older children displaying more pro-social behaviors and empathy."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Likewise, French et al."

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,2008).
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,researchers have also identified simultaneous benefits for younger and older children.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"For example, Goldman (1981) observed that in mixed-age classrooms younger and older children engaged in less parallel play and in more interactive play (Goldman 1981)."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"Similarly, in mixed- age classrooms parents and teachers made less comparisons based on age and focused more on children as individuals (Whale and Kantor 1992)."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,This resulted in a decrease in competition among peers and a focus on mastery oriented goals.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,Mixed-age classrooms were found to be especially beneficial for children with disabilities who benefit from the decrease in comparison and competition and the focus on individual goals that is natural in mixed-age classrooms (Blasco et al.

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,Support for Same-Age Classrooms nevertheless Piaget (1932) believed that children are more likely to construct knowledge and problem solve when they can exchange ideas with peers with similar skills and abilities.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",4,"According to Piaget, because of older children’s modeling and younger children’s imitation, younger children might miss out on the opportunity to create their own knowledge."

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,"On the other hand, challenging behaviors are some of the biggest concerns of preschool teachers, as behavior plays a central role in children’s ability to transition and adjust to school and succeed academically"
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,furthermore most teachers consider behavior a bigger challenge in early education than a lack of academic skill.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,"For example, Rimm- Kaufman, Pianta, and Cox (2000) found in a national representative group of kindergarten teachers in the United States, most teachers considered problem behaviors a bigger challenge in children’s adjustment to kindergarten than academic competency"
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,This finding points to the importance of looking at the preschool years as a key developmental stage to preventing challenging behaviors.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",5,"Both peer and teacher child interactions are central to positive academic experiences in preschool, and it is important to assess what group setting, mixed or same-age classrooms best promotes positive interactions"

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,Children learn to understand others as individuals with different skills and abilities and appreciate them for who they are and what they can accomplish in the present.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,This might reduce conflict during play and other activities as children learn to interact in more cooperative and less competitive ways.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,"In addition, the process of scaffolding might help develop pro-social behaviors and empathy in older children towards younger children and reduce conflict."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,"Similarly, younger children might gain social skills and become more competent peers, which would also result in reduced conflict."

"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,Montessori believed that in this specific environment mixed-age groups helped reduce classroom behavior challenges because mixed-age groups helped children regulate their emotions and behavior and display better social skills in their interactions with children and adults.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,"Montessori explained that as children came into the program and learned to regulate their emotions and behaviors, they taught their skills to new cohorts of younger children and modeled for them ways to deal with conflict in effective and positive ways."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,This reduced problem behaviors and peer conflict.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,"Children in Head Start classrooms in the United States are from similar backgrounds and experienced similar social risks to the children in Maria montessori s programs, and, thus, experienced similar benefits in mixed-age classrooms"
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,Teachers in mixed-age classrooms displayed less negative teacher child interactions than teachers in same-age classrooms
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,"As previous studies suggested, in mixed-age classrooms teachers develop individual expectations for each child based on their abilities and skills instead of developing generalized group expectations based on age."
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,This might reduce teachers’ frustrations and inappropriate expectations and result in less negative teacher child interactions
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,"Similarly, it is possible that as peer interactions and challenging behaviors decline, teachers engage in less negative interactions with the children in their classrooms"
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,The differences in teacher child interactions were found significant in the negative interactions category and not in the positive interactions category.
"Comparing peer interactions, teacher child interactions, and challenging behaviors in same age and mixed age preschool classrooms.pdf",10,This is common in adult child interaction research (Kuczynsky and Kochanska 1990).

Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,2,404 URBERG AND KAPLAN eluded that mixed-age rooms are more beneficial for the children because chil- dren in mixed-age rooms are more social than those in same-age rooms.

Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,2,Goldman also argues in favor of mixed- age rooms because she views the greater involvement of older children in solitary play in that setting as positive.

Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,2,"If these findings of asymmetries in social power among sibling dyads apply to unrelated children in groups, this suggests that younger children in a mixed-age setting may receive help from older children, but may be denied dominance and leadership roles."

Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,412 URBERG AND KAPLAN DISCUSSION Our results indicate that the play and social behavior of both older and younger preschoolers is affected by the age composition of their day care classroom.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,The age composition of the room seemed to have a greater effect on the social behavior of younger children than on that of older children.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"However, classroom age composition effected the play behavior of both younger and older children, although in somewhat different ways."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,The play behavior of the children in the two types of room differed in several ways.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"For the younger children, there was more positive interactive dramatic play and, for both younger and older children, there was more positive interac- tive functional play in mixed-age rooms."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,These types of interactive play seem to be the ones that could most easily accommodate cross-age play.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"In dramatic play, the older children can direct the play, assigning roles and mediating dis- putes in a way that younger children probably cannot (Fein, 1981)."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,interactive functional play is primarily movement oriented and involves little verbal interac- tion.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"As probably the least sophisticated and demanding type of interactive play, interactive functional play includes activities in which most children can easily participate"
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"This play may represent a decrease in the average level of play for the older children and an increase for the younger children, and therefore serve as the “common meeting ground” for children of different ages."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"For the younger children, there was both more positive interactive functional play and more total negative interactional play in mixed- than in same-age rooms."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,It may be that younger children have a harder time monitoring and de- escalating their behavior in the mixed-age classroom where the level of interac- tive functional play tends to be high.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"There was a trend, for younger children, toward more positive interactive cognitive play in mixed- than in same-age classrooms"
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"Since this category in- volved information sharing, and peer instruction activities as well as construct- ing things with another child, it is not surprising that young children more frequently experienced this kind of play in rooms with older children than in homogeneously young rooms."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,Sometimes they may have been drawn into such activities due to the ongoing activities of older children.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"Other times, they may have been taught by an older child such as when an older peer showed a book or explained a science display to a younger child."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,The type of interactive play found to be less frequent in mixed- than in same- age rooms was simple conversation
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"Thus, conversation may be an activity more often engaged in by children with similar levels of verbal fluency."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,"Field (1982), in fact, suggested that verbal fluency was one of the major factors in playmate selection."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,This finding is also congruent with Graziano’s (1978) laboratory based finding of more conversation in same-age triads than in mixed-age ones.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,10,This finding does not preclude Freedman’s (1982) suggestion that mixed-age rooms may facilitate language development in younger children.

Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"For older children, there was a trend toward more onlooker behavior, and for both older and younger children, there was more self care in the mixed-age rooms."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"Since the mixed-age rooms included a wide range of ages, teachers might have had a difficult time providing a sufficient variety of activities to keep all children interested and involved."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,The younger children may also have learned self care from the older children and become more capable.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,Possibly all the children were thrown on their own more to take care of themselves while the teachers met the demands of these very busy classrooms characterized by high levels of interactive functional play.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,difficulties in classroom management may also explain Goldman’s (198 1) finding of more solitary play and less participa- tion in teacher directed activities by older children in mixed-age rooms.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,Our hypotheses about the social behavior of young children in mixed- versus same-age classes were mostly confirmed.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"In accord with the results for sibling dyads abramovich et al., 1980), the younger children in the mixed-age rooms both received more prosocial behavior and more hostility than the young children in same-age rooms."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"However, there was no indication that young children in the mixed-age rooms were more often the victims of aggression than young children in same-age rooms."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"Thus, there is some evidence that abramovich s results from sibling dyads in a home setting do generalize to unrelated children in groups in a day care setting; however, a caution needs to be provided."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,Our data collection procedure did not allow us to determine whether the hostility and prosocial behavior that these young children received came primarily from the older children.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,These results do not provide a straightforward answer to the question of whether same- or mixed-age classrooms provide the best environment for pre- school children.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"At first glance, it appears that mixed-age classrooms may be preferable for two reasons."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"First, there was more group social interaction in these rooms."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"However, the results of the social behavior of the young children provide a cautionary note here."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,The young children in the mixed-age rooms received more prosocial behavior and expressed more affection than those in same-age rooms.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"While this seems unequivocally positive, the finding that they also re- ceived more hostility in mixed-age rooms suggests that further investigation into the causes of this hostility is warranted."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"Second, younger children engaged in more dramatic play in mixed-age rooms and showed a trend toward more interactive cognitive play."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"Dramatic play has been shown to have a number of positive effects (Connolly & Doyle, 1984; Saltz, Dixon, & Johnson, 1977)."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"However, these studies used age homogeneous groups."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,Whether these benefits will accrue to the younger child in a mixed-age group whose dramatic role may be less central (the baby or the dog) is still an open question.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,11,"Certainly, the trend toward more interactive cognitive play ap- pears to represent a benefit for the younger children in the mixed-age rooms,"
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,414 URBERG AND KAPLAN With respect to language development it is unclear whether same- or mixed- age settings are more beneficial
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,More simple conversation (without a dramatic or cognitive theme) occurred for both age groups in same- than in mixed-age rooms.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,This would appear to be a point in favor of the same-age classrooms
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,"On the other hand, slightly older models are widely believed to encourage language learning (Freedman, 1982)."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,"However, the long-term effects of more conversa- tion, or the presence of older children as models, on children’s overall language development are unknown."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,Perhaps the child can benefit from either situation.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,"Finally, the results suggest that the mixed-age setting may be problematic in some ways for both older and younger children."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,Older children engaged in more interactive functional play and less conversation which may represent a decrease in their average level of play.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,They also engaged in more self care and showed a trend toward more onlooker behavior which may have reflected some difficulty on the part of the teachers in meeting the needs of the older children in the room due to the greater demands of classroom management in a mixed age setting.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,"Although the overall rate of total negative interaction was low for both older and younger children, age composition had an effect on total negative interaction only for younger children."
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,Younger children were more likely to interact in negative ways in mixed-age rooms.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,interestingly they were also more likely to receive hostility in mixed- than in same-age rooms.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,It would be interesting to be able to tease apart the causes of these negative interactions
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,Perhaps there are frustrations inherent in interaction between children of different language and play skill levels that lead to these outcomes.
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,"In conclusion it has not been our intent to argue that mixed-age rooms are inferior, only that the benefits have been more assumed than demonstrated"
Effects of Classroom Age composition on th eplay and social behaviors of preschool children.pdf,12,The results of this study demonstrate some of the complex factors to be considered in making decisions about preschool classroom age composition

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"In the early 1980s, it was rare to have more than 15 children in a class."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"In 1993, one third of classes had at least 18 children."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"simultaneously with the increase in classes, the number of employees in child care centers decreased."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"During the 1980s, there were, on average, four children per full-time employee."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"in1993 the number of children per full time employee had increased to as much as six (Lidholt & Norrman, 1994)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,New laws have also had a significant impact on the Swedish child care system.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"Until 1991, profit-run child care centers could not, based on Swedish law, receive public funding."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"The average annual cost for one child in public agencies was about $10,000 US in 1993."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"The federal govern- ment and funding from local authorities subsidized approximately 90% of the cost, with parental fees financing the remaining 10%."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,This made it impractical to run private child care without public funding.

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,1,"The sample included 394 3- to 5-year-old children from 32 child care centers results show that the profit child care centers had larger child groups than nonprofit child care centers, a lower adult child ratio, and a positive staff attitude toward teaching goals."

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,92 Sundell authorities were authorized to help fund private child care.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"In Stockholm, for instance, private nonprofit and profit child care centers receive approximately the same subsidies as public centers, provided the centers comply with specified quality related parameters (e.g., the hiring of trained teachers, yearly evaluation and planning, accessibility for disabled and at-risk children)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"Nonprofit private child care in Stockholm has doubled between 1991 and 1994, leaving 16% of all children attending child care in private nonprofit centers and 5% in profit child care thus the transformations that occurred in the beginning of the 1990s within the Swedish child care system make a naturalistic experiment feasible."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,The main purpose of this study is to examine the potential effects of adult child ratio and profit child care on teaching and children’s social and cognitive achievements
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,according to kagan1991 a nonprofit organization such as public childcare is unlikely to exploit the consumer the parents because it can not distribute profit to those who control the organization
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,conversely in a profit oriented organiza- tion such as profit childcare in which parents can not directly evaluate the quality of the services the children actually receive and the children are not qualified to evaluate the services themselves there are motivation and legal sanctions to promote increased profit accordingly profit firms are more likely to cut costs and reduce quality.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"Based on this reasoning, nonprofit child care centers are likely to be superior in quality relative to profit child care centers."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"Research does not consistently verify this assumption however (Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995; Kagan, 1991; Penn, 1995)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"Although profit child care centers have been characterized by lower adult child ratios, they generally have a better- trained staff (Kagan, 1991; Penn, 1995)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"Group size and the quality of the environment including quality of interactions between staff and children are not clearly related to type of child care program (Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995; Kagan, 1991; Penn, 1995)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,adult child ratio is considered by policy researchers regulation authorities and lay persons to influence child care quality and children’s development
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"Statisti- cally reliable relationships have been moderately positive in some studies (e.g., clarke stewart Gruber, & fitzgerald 1994; Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team, 1995; Holloway & reichart erickson 1988; Howes, Phillips, & Whitebook, 1992; Howes, Rodning, Galluzzo, & Myers, 1988), whereas others eg broberg hwang lambketterlinus1989d eater deckard pinkerton Scarr, 1996; Palme´rus & Ha¨gglund, 1987; Russel, 1990; Scarr, Eisenberg, & d eater deckard 1994) have failed to support the notion of higher child care quality in cases with higher adult child ratios such contradictory findings suggest the importance of other predictors of child care quality."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"For instance, a strong consensus among teachers and their aides involves the idea that educational goals and the means to accomplish these goals could compensate for a decreased adult child ratio."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,This interpretation is consistent with the findings of Russel (1990) and Palme´rus and Ha¨gglund (1987).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,Variation in teacher education and experience are also likely relevant in explaining childcare quality clarke stewart etal1994 another possibility is that the relationship between childcare quality and adult child ratio is nonlinear.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,2,"In this respect, differences in the adult child ratio have a negligible effect beyond a certain ratio (e.g., 7 children or more per"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care 93 adult), but at lower ratios (e.g., 4–6 children per adult) are more likely to affect children’s development"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"Because studies concerned with adult child ratios have typically investigated the effects of differences between ratios of 1:7 or lower, clear, positive effects might not emerge until comparisons include both low and high ratios."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"Research on child care teaching provides only limited answers to questions of what constitutes high quality teaching (McCartney & Jordan, 1991; Scarr & Eisenberg, 1993; Stipek, Feiler, Daniels, & Milburn, 1995)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"traditionally child care practice in Sweden has been child centered, with a large proportion of staff time devoted to child initiated activities and indirect teaching, i.e., teaching is embedded in meaningful activities or connected to the child’s everyday experi- ences pearson leys1985 the aims of childcare practice are to provide both care and educational stimulation the stimulation of socio emotional development has been considered a critical factor."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"Most child care centers, regardless of teaching style usually allow the children to play freely throughout a large part of the day (Ekholm & Hedin, 1991; Sundell, 1988, 1994a)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"Explicit programs seldom regulate the instructional settings rather teaching is characterized by few fixed goals few teacher led activities and ample time for free exploration or free play (Ekholm & Hedin, 1991; Sundell, 1988, 1994a)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"It is rare that the teaching activities are organized in school related subjects (e.g., geography, arithmetic reading, and writing)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"However, there are examples of child care centers that use a more direct teaching method (Sundell, 1988, 1994a), in which the content is determined by the teachers themselves and the aim of the activities is to realize teacher goals."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"This demands planned, goal directed and teacher led activities activities that emphasize explicit skill teaching and a gradual transfer of respon- sibility for learning from the teacher to the pupil pearson leys1985 swedish studies (Ekholm & Hedin, 1991; Sundell, 1988, 1994a) on children’s social and cognitive achievements in child care also confirm the use of the dimension indirect versus direct teaching."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"In the present study, teaching was measured according to the degree of indirect versus direct teaching."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,One unique aspect of the Swedish child care system is the formation of age-mixed classes.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"Only 6% of all classes have same-aged children statistics Sweden, 1994)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"In 51%, the age span between the youngest and the oldest child is 3 years at most; in 43%, the age span is larger (e.g., children between 1 and 5 years of age the recommendation of mixed age as opposed to same age classes rests on the principle that young children have a natural propensity for social interaction"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"The wider age span, therefore, is assumed to increase the mixed-age interaction among the children, which, in turn, is assumed to promote children’s socio emotional and intellectual development (Swedish Government Official Re- ports, 1981)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"The presumed advantages with a mixed-age class are (a) it provides greater opportunities of cooperation and consideration among its members b the number of conflicts is reduced, (c) it is natural for older children to help younger ones, and (d) younger children learn from older ones (e.g., on how to resolve conflicts"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,3,"Swedish research, however, has not confirmed any of these assump- tions."

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,94 Sundell is likely to be detrimental to children’s speech and cognitive development but inconclusive when it comes to children’s social development
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,Child care research has typically evaluated children’s cognitive development using intelligence and verbal ability tests.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,furthermore it has addressed the issue of social development using ratings of sociability compliance and self regulation clarke stewart etal1994 however the bulk of research has relied heavily on single sources of measurement that might result in a serious measurement prob- lem regarding children’s social competencies (cf.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"Bierman, Smoot, & Aumiller, 1993; Coie & Dodge, 1988)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"Whereas peers probably have the best opportunities to comment on different aspects of social behavior, young children’s perceptions might be biased and undifferentiated"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"Teachers are likely to provide more differ- entiated ratings, but they might not have access to the variety of social contexts in which important peer interactions occur and they could be influenced by the impressions made by children in classroom settings."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,Direct observation provides an objective measure of children’s peer interaction
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"However, some important social behaviors probably occur with relatively low frequency and are thus difficult to assess in the restricted times and settings sampled by observations"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"Given the strengths and weaknesses of each measurement technique, the use of multiple measures (peer ratings, teacher ratings, and behavioral observations provides a more reliable basis for interpretation in comparison with the use of one method alone."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"Although research provides a tentative foundation for hypotheses concerning the relationship between type of child care (profit or nonprofit adult child ratio, age span in the child care class, teaching, and children’s development no particular study has included comparisons that encompass all of the above elements."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"The present study, therefore, examined how adult child ratio, age composition of child group and teaching were related to childrens achievements in non experimental profit and nonprofit childcare the child variables assessed included verbal abilities, intelligence and social competence"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"METHOD Setting Thirty-two child care centers (16 profit and 16 nonprofit all located in Stockholm, participated in the study."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"Of the nonprofit centers, eight were public and eight were private the latter are operated by parent cooperatives of the profit centers eight were run by the same company on a franchise basis and eight were smaller companies consisting of one or two centers and owned by the center’s director."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,"All directors, except for three, were trained child care center teachers and, on average, had worked 7 years as nursery school teachers."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,Two of the directors without nursery school education worked in private nonprofit childcare centers and one in a public child care center.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,All 16 directors in the profit child care centers had worked earlier in public child care.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,4,They based their decision to
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care 95 start a profit child care center primarily on the idea that there is greater opportu- nity to realize instructional visions.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,No one mentioned the prospect of becoming rich or of earning more money as an important motive separate analyses sundell sthle1996 revealed that none of the companies had made a significant profit during the assessment years 1994 and 1995.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,The public centers recruited their children through a general queue whereas the private child care centers used their own queuing system.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,The child care centers were selected to include the entire range of socioeco- nomic groups in the city.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"For each public center recruited, three private centers (one nonprofit and two profit) were recruited from the same neighborhood"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,The centers were located in diverse social housing areas.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"The frequency of residents living on social welfare benefits varied from 0.4% to 14.6% of the adults (M 5 4.5%, SD 5 3.5%); the frequency of apartment rentals varied from 0% to 68% m5179sd5196 the frequency of skilled and unskilled workers varied from 44% to 77% (M 5 60.6%, SD 5 9.6%); and the frequency of immigrants varied from 2% to 23% (M 5 8.1%, SD 5 5.4%)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,The four measures of socioeconomic status (SES) of the housing area were standardized using z-scores and then summed to yield a SES index.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,Internal consistency of the subscores of theses index was assessed by computing an alpha coefficient cronbach 1951
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"An alpha coefficient of .90 was observed, which compares well with generally accepted standards of reliability (De Vellis, 1991)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"The nonprofit and profit nursery schools did not differ significantly according to the neighborhood SES (M 5 0.00), F(1/31) 5 0.15."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"In addition to location, the only restrictions in recruitment were that the child care centers contain two or three child classes and that they had been in operation for at least one year at the time of the study."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,The reason for the restriction of the sample to only two or three child care classes was that child care centers run by parent cooperatives in Stockholm consisted of no more than three classes and there were no profit centers consisting of only one class.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"From each center, one class was randomly selected to be included in the study."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,Subjects From the 32 classes all 436 swedish speaking children between 3 and 5 years of age and their parents were asked to participate in the study.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,The refusal rate was only 1%.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,Thirty-one children did not participate because of illness.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"Thus, the final study group was composed of 394 (90%) of the original sample of children (106 in public, 79 in private nonprofit, and 209 in private profit child care centers)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"On the first visit, 117 children were in the age range 36 to 47 months, 142 were from 48 to 59 months, and 135 were from 60 to 71 months."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,5,"The group was made up of 47% boys, 12% were immigrants 21% belonged to working class families, 26% belonged to the middle class and 53% were from professional families in which one or both parents had professional or executive positions and graduate training."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"96 Sundell Procedure The classes were visited twice, once in the autumn and then five months later in the spring."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"For economic reasons, data collection was spread over a two-year period: 24 classes were visited in the autumn of 1993 and in the spring of 1994; 8 were visited in the autumn of 1994 and in the spring of 1995."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,By repeating the assessment of child development outcomes on two separate occasions during the study it was possible to look for relations that were replicated across time there was no significant difference p05betweenthe24 classes initially studied and the 8 studied one year later.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"The observers were graduate students in either psychology or pedagogy, had considerable experience working with children, and had extensive training in the testing procedures"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,The tests and interviews were administered individually in a separate room at the centers the tests took between 30and40 minutes per child
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"In addition to the tests and interviews teachers and aides were asked to rate each child on four behavioral dimensions all parents were asked to give their opinion of the center specify their involvement in the daily work of the school distinguish their social and occupational background identify their social network, and describe their childs earlier care arrangements childrens free play behavior was observed on several occasions in addition the observers studied the frequency of instructional caregiving and free activities during each assessment period of one week."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,Child assessments Cognitive achievement
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"Colored progressive matrices are considered well suited for use with young children because of their nonverbal attribute (Raven, Court, & Raven, 1995)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"This frequently used test has been reported to yield data of high reliability with children as young as four years old and is capable of measuring a person’s intellectual output in a rather pure factorial sense (Raven, Court, & Raven, 1995)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,Verbal Abilities.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,Children’s verbal abilities were evaluated by two subtests.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"The first, a vocabulary test ljung blad 1989), is similar to the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"The test includes 24 items, with each item consisting of four pictures, of which one corresponds to the item measured."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,Each item was read out loud to the child and the child was then asked to index the corresponding picture
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"According to Ljungblad (1989), the reliability split half of the test is .74."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,The second test measures children’s capacity to report a story to a doll that they themselves had heard earlier using pictures of the main characters in the story as a guide.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,The latter was used to minimize differential memory effects in children.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"The procedure and stimulus material are similar to those used previously (e.g., Feagans & Farran, 1981, 1994)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,Each story contained 19 information units with three action sequences.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,These information units were noun and verb phrases that were essential elements of the story.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,"For instance, the actors in the story were information units and each unique action by the actors was an information unit."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,6,Redundant information that occurred throughout the story was not considered a
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care 97 new information unit.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"The children’s responses were (audio) taped, transcribed and rated separately for level of production"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,Two different stories were used.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"If a child heard the first story in the autumn, then the second was used in the spring."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,The number of information units was the primary measure of accuracy of the paraphrase separate analyses of two random subsamples of the children revealed no significant differences between the two stories regarding the number of paraphrased information units in the autumn f12955016 and in the spring F (1/150) 5 0.25.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"Both verbal ability tests have been found to differentiate between children as young as 3 years of age (Sundell, 1994a)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,social skills
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,childrens social skills were assessed using three types of data
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"The first type of data, peer nominations was registered through interviews"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"The children were asked to name, from a photo of all the children in the group, three peers that they liked most to play with and three that they liked least the number of times a child was named by his or her peers was calculated for each child the average number of liked-most nominations was 2.14 (SD 5 1.65) in the autumn and 212sd5168 in the spring the average number of liked least nominations was 1.38 (SD 5 1.71) in the autumn and 1.58 (SD 5 1.87) in the spring."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,These scores were standardized (z-score) by center and used as the dependent variable in subsequent analyses.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"This approach was chosen after first using the standard- ized scores according to Coie and Dodge’s (1983) standard socio metric classifi- cation (i.e., popular, rejected, neglected, controversial and average)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"However, because preliminary analyses revealed low agreement in the classification be- tween fall and spring 006f030 the approach was eventually abandoned"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"The second type of data, behavior ratings, was attained through the teachers."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,Each child was rated according to its cooperative and fighting behavior.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"These dimensions are strongly related to children’s peer relations in kindergarten and elementary school newcombe bukowski pattee1993 cooperative refers to someone who is agreeable, cooperative and gives everyone a turn."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,The fighting dimension refers to children who have the tendency to initiate fights and argu- ments and whose general behavior is characterized by ill will.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"On both dimen- sions, teachers rated the child on a five-point scale (1 5 not at all characteristic of the child to 5 5 very characteristic of the child)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,The third type of data was behavior observations
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"For each observational period, the observer coded the social behavior samples of the child with peers or staff during free play within an observational period each child was observed 10 times with each sample lasting 15 seconds the time samples were spaced evenly throughout the observational period; i.e., the child’s behavior was coded approx- imately twice a day."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"For each observational unit, the observer recorded the incidence of any of 22 discrete behaviors or states (coded as present or absent within each interval), using a coding taxonomy from Lamb, Hwang, Bookstein, Broberg, Hult, & Frodi (1988)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"interobserver agreement, assessed by correlating the scores reported by independent observers, was satisfactory (rs ."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,.80).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,Fol- lowing Lamb et al.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"(1988), two composite variables were derived from the behavioral observations"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,7,"These included positive peer related behaviors (the sum of the observed indices of initiate play, imitate, touch, proffer, accept, and"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"98 Sundell laugh smile and negative peer directed behaviors the composite total for threats reject bid, take toys away from others, strike hit and cry)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"The means, standard deviations and Pearson’s correlation coefficients for the child assessment variables are depicted in Table 1."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"While most of the test retest correlations are comparatively high rs50 indicating that the data are reliable practically all of the inter correlations between the variables ranged from modest to moderate, which would argue against the reduction of child assessment vari- ables through composite variables."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"Thus, nine child assessment variables com- prised the final data analytic set."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,Predictors To explain children’s development 21 predictors were used.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"The predictors based on the results of Swedish investigations had been found to be positively related to children’s social and cognitive linguistic development (e.g., Ekholm & Hedin, 1991; Lamb et al., 1988; Sundell, 1988, 1994a)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,Family background
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"The child’s family background was measured by six variables: parents’ socioeconomic status (using a taxonomy developed by Statis- tics Sweden, 1982), family type (one- or two-parent families), cultural back- ground immigrant or nonimmigrant and social support system as described by the parents ie if the parents reported that people outside of the extended family eg social worker and child care center teacher were significant in the up bring ing of their child)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,Additional to these variables were the child’s age and gender.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,enrollment
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"By mapping each child’s child care experience through the preschool period, four enrollment variables were obtained: age at first entry into child-care (outside of own family), number of different child-care arrangements family child care center care relative etc"

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,child group
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,the total number of children in the class was registered as was the age composition of the class (the number of children younger than 3 years of age and the age span in months between the youngest and the oldest child in the class).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,adult to child Ratio.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,Data for personnel and children were collected on a monthly basis but are aggregated over a period of one year (from July to June).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,the number of half and full time employed staff was transformed into number of full-time staff.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,"In the parent cooperatives the parents’ normal work time (e.g., cleaning and cooking at the center was included in the staff data on average the adult child ratio was 6.3 children per full-time employee, with 4.6 as the lowest and 8.7 children as the highest value per full-time employee."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,Mixed-Age interaction
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,The children’s mixed-age interaction was registered using two measures the first was obtained through systematic observations each child was observed on 10 occasions in the autumn and 10 in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,8,The average age difference in months between the child and his or her playmates was then calculated

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,13,Group status was not a major determinant of individual differences among children and so was excluded from subsequent analyses consequently attention was focused on identifying important predictors of individual differences
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,13,"Cumulative Effects Multiple regression analyses with forced entry were conducted to examine the combined and independent contributions of the child’s age, gender, and family background from the regula table child care quality variables on children’s achievements"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,13,"This method is suitable for analyzing the collective and separate effects of two or more independent variables on a dependent variable (Pedhazur, 1982)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,13,Because some of the conceptually similar variables are highly correlated eg group size and adult child ratio only one of these variables was selected to represent both variables.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,13,representative variables were favored over combining variables into composites because the former seemed to represent the data more

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,"In some cases, conceptually different variables were highly correlated which would make them unfit to include into the equation."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,"Therefore, adult child ratio was preferred to staff consensus about teaching style."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,"After reducing the number of predictor variables, 14 variables remained."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,The correlations among these 14 predictors never exceeded 6 .36 (N 5 394).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,the contribution of the child sage and gender together with the childs family background was entered into the first equation.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,This conservative approach was used to remove the maximum variance attributed to differences in children’s family background before examining the influence of length of enrollment and child care.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,Variables associated with the child’s enrollment to out of home care were added in the second equation in the third equation regula table and process oriented components of child care quality were added.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,14,These models were computed separately for each assessment period and child assessment variable in
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care 105 Tables 5 and 6, the standardized regression coefficients (i.e., betas) and R2s are listed."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,Numbers printed in bold represent changes in variance explained (DR2).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"The first equation, including the child’s age, gender, and social background accounted for between 19% and 40% of the variance of the cognitive and verbal measures in the autumn and for 27% to 52% in the spring."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,The same variables accounted for between 2% and 15% of the variance with respect to the social measures in the autumn and between 4% and 20% in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,The overall multiple R2s in these regression analyses were all significant except that con- cerning negative peer directed behaviors in the autumn.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,Children’s age was the most important predictor in association with the assessment variables.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"The sig- nificant models indicated that cognitive, verbal, and social achievements were higher in older children, regardless of assessment period."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,In addition to being rated as more belligerent and less cooperative boys received more nominations that were negative on both assessment occasions immigrant children showed less positive peer directed behaviors regardless of assessment occasion but were also rated high on cooperative and low on fighting behaviors in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,Immigrant children’s vocabulary was lower in the autumn.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"Children from single parent families were generally found to be less socially involved, received negative nominations more frequently and performed poorer on the cognitive and vocab- ulary tests."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"When the parents had reported the importance of people outside the extended family in the fostering of their child, the child showed better verbal abilities in both the autumn and spring but was rated less sociable in the spring."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"In the second equation, the variables associated with enrollment were added, which significantly increased the variance accounted for in two of the nine dependent measures in the autumn and in four of the nine measures in the spring"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,Different child care arrangements do not seem to impede child development
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,A variety of arrangements were associated with better vocabulary and positive peer directed behaviors at both assessments and higher cognitive scores in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,The result of many hours spent each day in child care proved more complex.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,A greater number of hours in child care tended to increase the positive peer directed behaviors and positive socio metric nominations but also increased the negative peer directed behaviors at both assessments
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"An early age at first entry out of homecare seems to have largely positive consequences this variable accounted for better cognitive achievement at both assessments and a better vocabulary in the spring; however, it also accounted for more fighting and less positive peer directed behaviors in the spring."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,The final equation constituted the five regula table and process oriented child care variables.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"As shown in Table 5, these variables provided a significant increase in the adjusted R2 for three of nine dependent indicators in the autumn."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,"In contrast to the second equation, the variance significantly increased in eight of nine dependent indicators in the spring assessment table 6thus controlling for age, gender, family background different enrollment variables, and regula table and process child care variables all proved important for children’s cognitive and social performance"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,15,The major reason for the increase could be linked to age span.

Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"108 Sundell children showed negative peer directed behaviors with greater frequency, and they received more negative peer nominations"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,In the spring assessments a large age span was found associated with an increase in the occurrence of positive peer nominations and positive peer directed behaviors.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"However, age span was not strongly related to the rate of age homogenous play (Table 2); nor did the observed age difference to playmates explain the children’s cognitive, verbal, or social assessments coherently"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,the staff to child ratio was important in two of the measures in the autumn and for three of the measures in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,In two of these measures the relationship indicated that a higher adult child ratio was less favorable since it increased the likelihood of fighting behavior in the autumn and negative peer directed behaviors in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,The teaching index was a significant predictor in two of the measures in the autumn and in two of the measures in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"In the autumn, direct teaching predicted increased vocabulary and decreased positive peer directed behaviors, while the spring assessments indicated that indirect teaching increased cognitive achievement and the cooperative behaviors."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,The number of teachers among the staff proved to be of no importance in predicting children’s achievements
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,Although the overall multiple regression coefficients for these analyses were highly significant they were not large in absolute terms for the indicators of children’s social development
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,The full model accounted for between 22% of the cognitive and 43 of the verbal measures in the autumn and 32 of the cognitive and 61% of the verbal measures in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,The corresponding figures for the six social indicators were from 11% to 22% in the autumn and from 10% to 23% in the spring.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,The variances accounted for by the spring models were higher than the autumn models in seven of nine dependent measures.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"The age, gender, and family background variables were largely responsible for the increased explana- tory power."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"DISCUSSION This study examined how the adult to child ratio, age composition in child care classes, and instructional style were related to children’s achievements in non- experimental profit and nonprofit child care."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"The child variables assessed in- cluded cognitive verbal and social competence these child assessment variables were measured twice, five months apart, revealing comparably stable relation- ships."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,It was demonstrated that program auspice (profit and nonprofit) and different ratios of staff to children 146187 were not systematically related to children’s social and cognitive achievements
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"The children’s cognitive, verbal, and social achievements were best predicted by age, sex, social background and the age span of the class."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,18,"These findings confirm earlier studies, suggesting that the ratio of caregiver to children (Broberg et al., 1989; d eater deckard et al., 1996palmerushagglund1987 russel 1990scarreisenberg1993s carr et al., 1994) and program auspice (Cost, Quality & Child Outcome Study Team,"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care 109 1995; Kagan, 1991; Penn, 1995) are not related to either instructional style or children’s development"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"Although the data are purely associative the findings suggest that, at least in Sweden, program auspice (profit vs. nonprofit) and adult child ratios neither significantly enhance nor obstruct children’s social or cognitive development"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"The multiple regressions for the fall and spring data yield somewhat different patterns of childcare predictors concerning child outcomes this is not surprising given the comparably weak statistical relations for all predictors except age such weak relations increase the importance of the lower cut-off level of statistical significance (i.e., .05)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,Several of the differences between fall and spring consist of one relationship just below the critical border normally fall and one just above (normally spring).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"The variance accounted for by the child care quality variables exceeded 10% only once, and was mostly in the range 2%—5%."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"However, this moderate range is in accordance with earlier research on childcare eg broberg Wessels, Lamb, & Hwang, 1997; d eater deckard et al., 1996; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1998) and school instruction (e.g., gustafsson 1998; Scheerens & Bosker, 1997)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"Although the child care predictors differ in some degree between fall and spring, for the most part they uniformly increased the variance explained in children’s social and cognitive achievements variance."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,these variables provided a significant increase in the adjusted r2 for three of nine dependent variables in the fall assessment and for eight of nine dependent variables in the spring assessment
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,The stronger association between children’s achievements and the child care quality variables in the spring is consistent with the results of an earlier swedish study sundell1988in that study the child care quality variables increased accountability from fall to spring in five of seven cognitive and social achievement measures these results indicate the presence of a time lag before the child care quality is manifested in children’s achievements
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"The concept of a main effect of child care quality on children’s achievements however, is complicated because child care teaching in Sweden undergoes sig- nificant changes during the school year in the fall the staff expends considerably more energy to establish a social structure in the child care center a structure that provides latitude for teacher led activities during the late fall and early spring."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"In the beginning of summer the structure is normally relaxed, with teacher led activities occurring less frequently and where a sizable amount of time is reserved for outdoor activities"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"although the present results do not support the assumption egkagan1991 that nonprofit is superior to profit child care, one must bear in mind that the current conditions in Stockholm favor small differences between nonprofit and profit child care."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"First, if the activities of profit child care centers comply with government regulated demands for quality (e.g., hire trained teachers, yearly evaluation and planning, open for disabled and at-risk children), then they get approximately the same subsidies as do public centers."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"Second, 13 out of 16 profit center directors had worked earlier in public centers."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,"Their motive to start such a center was to realize instructional goals that they believed were difficult, if not impossible to attain in a public center."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,No director raised the prospect of earning more money as an important motive.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,19,Evidence indicates that none of the
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"110 Sundell companies had made a significant profit during 1994 (Sundell & Ståhle, 1996)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"Third, most staff (87%) were either trained nursery school teachers or assistant teachers, a variable found to correlate with high quality care and children’s wellbeing eg clarke stewart etal1994 thus it is reasonable to suggest that our results might have been different ifa the profit centers had been operated by directors without childcare experience b monetary profit was a primary motive and (c) staff personnel lacked adequate training in childhood education."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,One interpretation that could account for the lack of a significant relationship between degrees of adult child ratios and children’s achievements is that the relationship is nonlinear.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"In this view, the adult child ratio makes little difference within a moderate range (e.g., 4–8 children per caregiver) but extreme ratios are more likely to affect children’s development"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"Although the adult child ratio ranged from 1:4.6 to 1:8.7, with 29 of 32 groups having ratios of less than 1:8, these ratios are higher compared with, for example, the Federal interagency Day Care requirements for preschool children (cf."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"Howes et al., 1992)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"Hence, these relatively high ratios could explain the lack of linearity between adult child ratios and children’s achievements"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,A second explanation is that the consensus among the teachers and teacher aides concerning specific goals and the ways to accom- plish these goals compensated for a decreased adult child ratio the present results tend to support this latter explanation
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"Thus, because the staff agreed on the teaching practice, a change in ratio of about one or two children per adult may have had little or no impact on the instructional work."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,This conclusion is supported by the findings of Palme´rus and Ha¨gglund (1987) and Russel (1990).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"These authors found that the majority of recorded child behaviors changed little, if at all, with an increase in ratio."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"A third explanation suggested by Andersson (1989, 1992), is that the effects of the adult child ratio are detectable first after several years."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"In this study, teaching was measured using the dimension direct vs. indirect."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,The results indicate that teaching style was of limited importance for children’s performance
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"nonetheless it should be noted that the average time devoted to teacher planned and teacher led activities was 11% (range 3% to 27%), with free play occurring about 50% of the time."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"The remaining time was spent performing caregiving activities (e.g., meals, rest, and toilet related activities"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,The staff rarely took part in free-play activity (only 3% of the time).
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"The low frequency of teacher led activities could also explain the lack of relationships between the teaching index and childrens cognitive and social achievements the fact that the teaching index changed little with the adult child ratio indicates that the same type of instructional practice was given to children under each ratio; that is, the same type of activities were made available ie mainly free activities to children and staff maintained a similar teaching style across ratios."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,of the regula table childcare quality variables age span within the class was the strongest predictor of children’s social and cognitive achievements
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,20,"This finding concurs with earlier studies (Sundell, 1994a, 1994b), indicating that larger age spans (e.g., 50 months between the oldest and youngest child), in which the nursery school class comprises toddlers and preschool children, are primarily inferior to smaller age spans (e.g., 25 months), where toddlers and preschool"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care 111 children are allocated to separate classes this is contrary to the beliefs expressed in Swedish official documents (Swedish Government Official Reports, 1981), which assume that a large age span is beneficial to children’s social, cognitive, and verbal development"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,The question remains whether the smaller age spans in this study are superior to an age homogenous group.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"comparisons of age span of two years or less (e.g., Brownell, 1990; French, Waas, Stright, & Baker, 1986; Goldman, 1981; Lougee, Grueneich, & Hartup, 1977; Stright & French, 1988) indicate that somewhat larger age spans are beneficial to children’s development"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"the exact reason for the disadvantages of age mixed classes is not clear accord ing to earlier Swedish research (Sundell, 1994b), a large age span is inferior because teaching becomes more complicated to both plan and actualize in the mixed-age class."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"There is, for instance, in mixed-age classes a larger cognitive demand on the teacher to retain knowledge of several age groups current at the same time."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"Moreover, additional time for blueprinting instruction is needed because there involves planning for more age groups."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"furthermore in the mixed- age class, toddlers’ special needs, such as changing diapers, often interrupt the teacher planned activities for older children however this study indicated only a weak relationship between the age span of the class and the teaching index, possibly because of the low number of teacher led activities"
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,It is also possible that a qualitative approach would have clarified the control of age span on instruction
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,Another explanation of the results is that mixed-age classes provide fewer opportunities for advanced interaction among playmates in theory the mixed age class provides better opportunities for children to learn from each other and to enhance their knowledge.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"The relationship between collaboration and learning seems to be more complex than is suggested by this theory however in our data there was no substantial relationship between the observed average ages of the playmates or the average ages of the preferred playmates in the positive socio- metric nominations and in the childrens achievements furthermore the children in this study seem to favor same-aged playmates, irrespective of the age compo- sition of the class."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"The average age difference of the playmates was only six months a surprisingly low figure given that the average number of playmates that was at most six months older or younger was 5outof16 it is noteworthy that the relationship between the age span in the child group and the age difference of playmates was not significant a finding in accord with the findings in other studies (Goldman, 1981; Ellis, Rogoff, & Cromer, 1981)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"It is also possible that some of the assumptions about the mixed-age groups are correct, but that the mixed-age groups have other, more negative, consequences that transcend the positive ones."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"For example, it is reasonable that older pupils’ instruction of younger peers in mixed-age classes affects their verbal and cognitive development and social competence devin sheehan Feldman, & Allen, 1976)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"At the same time, the problems associated with planning teacher led activities result in a slower pre- sentation of new information which inadvertently creates a disadvantage specific to children in mixed-age classes."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,"Finally, mixed-age classes might be an advan- tage for younger but not for older children (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliam, 1993; Howes & Farver, 1987)."
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,21,accordingly mixed-age classes are initially
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,22,112 Sundell beneficial to younger children but this advantage is reversed as the children become older.
Examining Swedish Profit and Nonprofit Child Care.pdf,22,These alternative interpretations require further study.

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,The context of the study was early years education.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,The study has two parts: The first part small multi age groups science learning early years involved classes attended by preprimary children aged 4-6.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,The science education role of age second part included one primary class attended by students in mixed age grouping aged 6-8 in addition to the preprimary classes.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,Students were learning science in small involved in inquiry based science activities
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,Two sources of data groups were used: Lesson recordings and children’s assessments
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,The data from both sources were separately analyzed and the findings plotted.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,The resulting graphs indicate a linear relationship between the overall performance of the younger children in a class and the number of older ones participating in the groups in each class.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,It seems that the age composition of the groups can significantly affect the overall cognitive achievements of the younger children and preferentially determines the time within which this factor reaches its maximum value.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,The findings can be utilized in deciding the age composition of small groups in a class with the aim of facilitating the younger children’s learning in science.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,"introduction students learning through interacting with each other rather than only with their teacher is of much interest to educational researchers and practitioners it is also a highly evaluated goal (Webb, 1989)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,"The social skills of individuals allow them to participate in learning activities in small groups and learn from each other (Huber & Huber, 2007)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,Vygotsky (1978) suggested that children’s knowledge and ideas develop through interactions with others.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,"In his view social interactions with more capable peers play a key role in under- standing the meaning of concepts, and thus in learning."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,2,"To achieve this, students need a learning environment that promotes interactive learning processes, preferably from the lower grades of education huberhuber2007 at the heart of this view of learning is the situation or context within which learning takes place."

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"Examples of such environments are small mixed ability cooperative groups, the use of which is supported by extensive evi- dence from numerous studies (e.g."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"blumenfeld Marx, Soloway, & Krajcik, 1996; Gillies, 2003; Katz, 1995; Nastasi & Clements, 1991)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"Students in small heterogeneous groups help, share and support each other’s learning as their members provide information prompts, cues and encouragement in response to other children’s needs (Gillies, 2003; has sarddias2009 often they are more aware of their peers needs than their teachers and can explain problems in a way that can be readily understood webbfarivar1994"
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"It has been found that children achieve more when they work together in small groups than they do in whole class, attain higher academic outcomes and are more motivated to achieve (Gillies, 2003; Lou et al., 1996)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"small cooperative groups are used in several countries across all levels of education not only for supporting and improving students learning motivation and attitudes blumen feld et al., 1996; Slavin, 1983), but also as a way of handling large classes (Slavin, 1983)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"In science education, a large number of studies on instructional practices have given results showing the effectiveness of small groups of children of mixed abilities (Hassard & Dias, 2009)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,Hassard and Dias (2009) note that the term collaborative emphasizes the importance of verbal communication between students during their interactions in a small group when they work on a specific task.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"Krajcik, blumenfeld Marx, and Soloway (2000) mention that one of the aims of collaboration and interaction is to build knowledge through talks and discussion this collaboration also introduces the stu dents to the language of the discipline under study and to ways of knowledge acquisition"
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"While small group learning has a long history (Wagner, 1982), it is only in the last decades that researchers have studied the interactions within them that facilitate learning and the factors that lead to different patterns of interaction (Webb, 1989)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,One of these factors is the number of participants in a small learning group.

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,(1996) have found that children’s benefits from small group work are contingent on group size and composition
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,Huber and Huber (2007) suggest that groups should comprise as many members as are still able to interact directly with each other.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,Another factor that has proved to be important is the age of the members of a small group.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"Furman, Rahe, and Hartup (1979) maintain that socialization in mixed-age groups serves children in many ways that same age socialization does not and note that mixed age groups require accom modation s between individuals whose developmental levels differ it has been found that learning more usually takes place through the interactions of older children with younger ones."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"Katz (1995) notes that mixed-age grouping, especially in early childhood settings, is intended to increase the heterogeneity of the group so as to capitalize on the differences in knowledge, ability and experience of the children."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,The study suggests that in a mixed-age group younger children are capable of participating in and contributing to more complex activities than they could initiate if they were by themselves
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,3,"Katz (1995) also reports that research on social benefits indicates that children very early associate different expectations with different age groups: for example, younger children assign older ones instructional leadership helpful and sympathizing roles, whereas older"

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"Modelingis the processby which younger children pick up behaviors they observe in older ones if older students and younger students work closely while engaging in learning activities the younger students will seek to imitate the behaviors modeled by the older ones (Merrick, 1996)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,Younger children will imitate both academic and social behaviors demonstrated by older children merrick 1996 maintains that nothing is more interest ing to a child than another child who has the skills that he/she would like to acquire.

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,in the present work we are concerned with the learning in science of children in early years education (4–8 years of age).
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"Two previous studies (Kallery, 2011, 2015) of the science related performance of children aged 4–6 who worked in small multi-age groups during inquiry based science activities have documented high overall learning achievements in the children participating in the activities"
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"based on the issues outlined above in the present study we investigate the overall per formance in science of the younger children in a class where they participated in small mixed-age groups, in an effort to see whether this factor is influenced by the proportion of older children in the groups."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,The present study allows us to quantify the role of age composition in small science learning groups these findings can be very useful in decid ing how to group children in a class to facilitate the younger ones’ learning in science.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,The question leading our research is: .
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,how do the overall cognitive achievements in science of the younger children in a class where the students work in small multi age groups change in relation to the number of older children participating in those groups?
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"Context The present study was conducted in Greece and involved students from the two lowest levels of education, preprimary and primary."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,In the Greek educational system pre- primary and primary schools operate separately with different daily and weekly timeta- bles.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,The composition of the classes is also different.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"preprimary classes are mostly multi-age, and are usually attended by an average of 20 children aged 4–6."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,4,"At this level, the age groupings are: 45pre kindergarteners (PKs) and 56 kindergarteners (Ks)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,international journal of science education 1573 there are a few cases depending on enrollment where some classes are composed of chil dren of the same age group that is either only of pre kindergarteners or only ofkinder- garteners.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,"preprimary teachers are required to implement the National Curriculum for preprimary Education, which proposes two kinds of activities for the children: ‘free’ activities which are chosen and carried out by the children themselves without the direct involvement of the teacher, and teacher organized activities which are planned and organized by the teacher according to the objectives that have to be met."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,"Teachers can organize activities on topics relating to phenomena that children encounter in every day life or topics arising out of the childrens interests or questions if the childrens inter ests do not bring up issues which the teacher considers important and appropriate for pre primary children, she/he can design activities to meet a selected objective, choosing the topic, content and instruction materials accordingly"
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,"Domains from which the topics for activities can be drawn include physics and outer space the physics curriculum pro poses topics relating to concepts such as weight, sound, light, motion, temperature and magnetism, basic characteristics of materials and properties of matter such as floating/ sinking, melting, dissolving in water, etc."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,space related topics include Earth’s sphericity and motions and the phenomenon of day and night.

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,"primary school starts at age 6 and is of six years duration the classes are composed of children of the same age group (first grade 6–7 years of age, second grade 7–8, etc.)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,In primary school the teaching of topics related to physics and outer space starts system at i cally at the fourth grade however in a framework called flexible zone of activities the National curriculum for primary education provides opportunities for innovative peda- gogical and didactical approaches (e.g.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,classes of children from different grades) and allows the introduction of concepts and phenomena that complement those introduced through the formal program and enhance the basic skills that the formal activities pro- posed by the curriculum are expected to develop.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,These may be related to experiences that children commonly encounter in everyday life.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,"Teachers may also identify topics that they consider to be interesting important and appropriate for children of specific ages, which may not be included in the tight weekly timetable of the school program."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,5,"They can, in other words, select objectives and design activities choosing the topic, content and instruction materials accordingly"

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,Activities were hierarchically sequenced in order to support construction of meaning.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,implementation began in October and ended in May.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,in the activities children worked in groups traditionally group work involves four to six students huberhuber2007 in our study groups of five students were formed we felt that this was a number that provides good opportunities for interaction between members and allows for different age combinations within the group.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,"Since each child has a probability of interacting with each of the others in the group, we assumed that when there are fewer younger than older children in a group each of the younger children will have a higher probability of interacting with an older one thus for the purpose of our study, we varied the number of younger children in the groups in each of the classes, keeping the total size of each group at 5 (all groups in a class had the same age composition"
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,"the teachers whose classes took part in the study had been members of a workgroup for many years (average 11 years), facilitated by a researcher in science education with a background in physics (first author of the present paper)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,"All of the teachers had long experience in teaching science at the corresponding levels of education and, as members of the above mentioned work group, had participated in the development of the instruction material used in science activities (Kallery, 2016)."
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,"nonetheless before implementing the activities the teachers and the researcher discussed the content and methodology of the activities in group meetings also all of them used the same teachers guide during the implementation these teachers being members of the above mentioned work group for many years, had participated in research projects several times and were very experienced in making observations recording dataand performing student assess- ments during actual classroom work as well as post instructional assessments"
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,description of the parts of the study Part 1 The first part of the study involved only preprimary children.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,Three of the four classes participating in Part 1 comprised children of the age groups 4–5 and 5–6 years; the fourth had only children aged 4–5 pre kindergarteners
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,The age composition of the groups depended on the number of children of each age group enrolled in the school.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,6,thus in the school attended only by children of the age group 45 the groups were com posed only of pre kindergarteners and constituted the control class.

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,7,The reason for including primary students in the study was to find out whether the same pattern (model) of performance of the younger children would be repeated when students at a higher level but still within the early years age bracket (4–8) were taking part.
Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,7,The rest of the classes participating in Part 2 were the new preprimary classes of the same teachers who took part in Part 1.

Learning science in small multi-age groups the role of age composition.pdf,19,The outcomes of the present study show that in mixed-age small group learning in science the age composition of the groups can significantly affect cognitive achievement and preferentially determine the time in which this factor reaches its maximum value.

Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,13,when looking at the specific classroom level processes that accounted for this significant attenuation results indicate that over 25 of the attenuation in the association between kindergarten type and childrens math and liter acy skills was attributed to the time children spent in child selected activities see table 3 although not statistically significant ps1518roughly1015 of these differences in test scores were also attributed to the fact that children in multigrade classrooms that enrolled both pre kindergartners and kindergartners had a greater number of classmates who were below grade level in academics in contrast to childrens academic performance none of the mediators explained a significant share of the differences in children's cognitive flexibility or any of the other outcomes of interest

Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,14,"to begin only a small share of the overall kindergarten population in the united states attends classrooms that also serve pre kindergarteners however at the population level these estimates translate to roughly 57000 children or2 of children which is smaller than the share of children in multigrade classrooms at older ages5 in contrast to social learning and cognitive theories of child development bandura1986vygotsky1978 the results from this investigation revealed that 5 year old children who were enrolled in classrooms that served both pre kindergarteners and kindergarteners fared less well academically than those who attended kindergarten only classrooms these differ ences in childrens academic skills corresponded with 4to65 months of academic development children in multi grade classrooms also demonstrated less optimal executive functioning than did 5 year olds who attended kindergarten only classrooms but similar to prior studies in this area of work (Ansari et al., 2016; Thomas, 2012; veenman1995 children in multigrade classrooms were not consistently performing any better or worse than their classmates in areas of social behavior"
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,14,"although prior studies suggest that the effects of multigrade education are mixed egmarianokirby2009 thomas 2012 much of this literature has sampled older children during first or second grade and beyond this lack of empirical attention on the transition to school is not able as the skills that children demonstrate in kindergarten are predictive of their short and long term school success as well as their long term wellbeing through the transition to adulthood duncan etal2007 entwisle alexander 1989jonesetal2015 for these reasons future studies should consider the relative age of children to determine whether the effects of multigrade classrooms change as children get older in fact recent analyses of preschool programs reveal much the same pattern as those reported here older children who were enrolled in classrooms with a greater number of younger children performed less well academically than older children in preschool classrooms with fewer younger children ansarietal2016molleretal 2008 therefore the implementation of multigrade and mixed age classrooms during early childhood and the tran sition to school requires greater scrutiny just because children in multigrade classrooms do no better or worse than children in single grade classrooms during first grade and beyond egthomas2012veenman1995 does not mean that such practices produce no differences when implemented at kindergarten when taken together the results of this study are in line with the findings reported by mariano and kirby2009 who found that multigrade classrooms were less conducive for childrens academic achievement however the effect sizes reported here in were somewhat larger 1020 of a standard deviation vs10 of a standard deviation the effect sizes reported as part of this study 15227219, 2017, 6, Downloaded from https online library wileycomdoi101002icd2036 by universiteit s bibliotheek Gent, Wiley Online Library on 16032023"

Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,moving to the second take home message the reasons that multigrade classrooms appear to have a deleterious effect on childrens educational outcomes have been understudied but this study was able to identify meditational processes for their associations with kindergarteners development not only do the results from this investigation demonstrate that the experiences of children in these classrooms were qualitatively different children in multigrade classrooms that served both pre kindergartners and kindergartners experienced significantly less literacy stimulation and spent less time in teacher directed activities but also these classroom level processes mediated the negative associations that were documented between multigrade classrooms and children's academic achievement
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,"Thus, one of the underlying explanations why children in multigrade classrooms performed less well academically was because they received less teacher directed instruction"
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,"It is important to interpret these mediation al findings in the context of the existing literature on classroom pedagogy which also suggest that more time spent in quality did ac tic teacher directed instruction facilitates children's early academic achievement (Barnett, 2011; Mashburn et al., 2009piantabelsky vandergrift houts morrison 2008stipekfeiler daniels milburn 1995 at the same time however more time spent in didactic instruction has been found to result in less optimal social behavioral devel opment among young children stipeketal1995"
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,"nonetheless when taken as a whole, these meditational analyses indicate that there are, in fact, “indirect” pathways between multigrade education and childrens early academic learning from a practical perspective these indirect pathways may prove to be malleable targets for intervention which can be a first step in addressing the longstanding concerns of multigrade classrooms (Mason & Burns, 1996)."
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,"These findings are especially important when considering that some multigrade programs and by extension mixed age programs are implemented owing to economic and logistical constraints and therefore, separately serving 4‐ and 5‐year‐old children is likely to be challenging for some kindergarten programs"
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,"despite these potential mechanisms that underlie the associations between multigrade classrooms and childrens academic achievement the mechanisms for childrens executive function were unclear although this study could not uncover these processes one might further speculate that classroom management and quality which prior studies have found to be positively associated with childrens executive function rimm kaufman cur by grimm nathanson & brock2009 Weiland, Ulvestad, Sachs,& Yoshikawa, 2013), are two alternative pathways for the documented associations"
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,unfortunately the ECLS‐K data did not have indicators of classroom quality or specific information on what teachers were doing in the classroom during the different types of activities to test such hypotheses
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,considering the fact that childrens executive functioning rapidly evolves during this period continued work is neces sary to explore the pathways through which multigrade classrooms may affect childrens development of executive function skills
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,"As with any study, the results of this study need to be interpreted in light of its limitations beyond those discussed above primarily the eclskclassof20102011 included a nationally representative sample of kinder gar ten ers not pre kindergarteners and thus these data can not and do not speak to the benefits of multigrade educa tion for the preschool age children who were enrolled in these classrooms whether younger children benefit from having older children in the classroom remains contested with some scholars documenting positive effects (Guo, tompkins justice petscher2014 and others documenting null or negative associations ansarietal2016bell etal2013molleretal2008 thomas 2012veenman1995 and therefore remains a topic for future research"
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,it should be kept in mind however that even if the younger children were to benefit from having kindergarteners in the classroom these data suggest that it would be at the expense of the older childrens academic achievement and executive functioning
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,15,"Second, although several precautions were taken to address potential selection bias (e.g., lagged dependent variable analyses and propensity score matching the results reported here in need to be interpreted with caution because children were not randomly assigned to multigrade and kindergarten only classrooms additional analytical strategies eg random assignment and instrumental variables must be used to build on this correlational evidence 15227219, 2017, 6, Downloaded from https online library wileycomdoi101002icd2036 by universiteit s bibliotheek Gent, Wiley Online Library on 16032023"

Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,16,16of19 ANSARI to test for causal associations even so it is encouraging that the outcomes associated with multigrade classrooms were largely the same across model specifications moreover although the sample provided enough statistical power to detect meaningful differences the small sample of children in multigrade classrooms limited the types of analyses that could be conducted future studies therefore should consider oversampling children in multigrade classrooms which in turn will allow for a stronger assessment of the underlying mechanisms for these documented associations
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,16,in doing so future studies can also consider potential moderating variables to determine under what context or conditions these effects are amplified or attenuated relatedly future studies should inspect of the long term implications of multi versus single grade education and would greatly benefit from stronger and more detailed measures of classroom pro cesses which would allow for a better evaluation of the degree of difference across classrooms finally closer attention must be paid to variation within multigrade classrooms in order to determine whether and why some multigrade pro grams are more successful than others for example understanding whether programs were implemented for pedagogical or logistical reasons is necessary because it is likely that pedagogical as compared with logistical implementation will account for distinct outcomes whereas logistical implementation may indicate a lack of training
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,16,"in sum this study provided a large scale national portrait of multigrade education during the kindergarten year that can be built on by more intensive multimethod community based approaches in the future the results of this study also provided some of the first evidence to suggest that, at the national level, 5 year olds who attended multigrade kindergarten classrooms with pre kindergartners were performing less well academically than 5 year olds who attended kindergarten only classrooms classroom level processes largely explained these differences if future studies can address the limitations of this study and replicate the findings reported herein then this research would have potential developmental and policy implications for children's learning during the transition to school."
Multigrade kindergarten classrooms and children's academic.pdf,16,specifically with the small number of programs that combine prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms in the united states these results suggest that when possible their implementation may need to be reevaluated

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,1,Ample studies have been dedicated to the explication of individual differences in parental caregiving behavior and many were inspired by belskys1984 seminal model of the determinants of parenting the model assumes parenting to be shaped by multiple determinants in three domains 1 parental personality or personal psychological resources 2 child characteristics and (3) contextual sources of stress and support.

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,although we expected factors from the three domains to contribute to the quality of caregiver behavior in each of the three observed situations we did not exclude the possibility that the contribution of individual factors to the quality of caregiver behavior might be different depending on the situation in which the caregiver child interaction was observed
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,for example workload and support experienced from colleagues may explain more variance in caregiver behavior as observed during everyday interactions with the children throughout an entire morning than during a relatively short structured play episode with a small group of children we therefore decided to keep the three sit ations apart and explore whether the behavior of the caregivers in the different situations was related to different combinations of predictors
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,3,"in the present study we observed different caregivers working in the same childcare groups and caregivers from different groups in the same child care centers this allowed us to use multilevel analysis to examine what part of the variance in the quality of caregiver behavior lies at the three different levels (i.e., the individual caregiver, the child care group and the child care center as well as how much variance at each of the levels is explained by the potential determinants this information may be helpful in interpreting the possible effects of the specific predictors of caregiver behavior included in the present study as well as in discussing possible sources of the variance that remains unexplained by the present predictors we expected part of the variance in the behavior of the professional caregivers to lie at the level of the child care group and at the level of the child care center that is because some of the influences that mold the quality of caregiver behavior may be group specific such as support from colleagues or age of the children in the care group or center specific such as support from the supervisor or years of existence of the center because the"

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,Discussion the present study was the first to examine the multiple determinants of parenting to professional caregiving in child care centers.
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,"The model we found for the determinants of caregiving in the participating centers corresponds with the basic proposition of belskys1984 model of the determinants of parenting that caregiver behavior is shaped by factors from three domains, namely caregiver, child and contextual characteristics"
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,"As regards the first, the ages of the participating caregivers explained a significant part of the variance in their behavior toward the children during the lunchtime and cis overall observations with older caregivers providing higher quality care in the child domain the age of the children in the care group proved to be an additional predictor of the quality of care in all three of the observed situations with groups including younger children receiving lower quality care."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,"And finally, in the domain of contextual characteristics a single aspect of qualitative occupational workload namely higher physical load uniquely predicted a lower quality of caregiver behavior toward the children during the structured play period and cis overall"
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,although the above findings were in line with our hypotheses several of our outcomes were strikingly deviant first of all against expectations the caregivers general mood scores reflecting their ability to enjoy life and experience a general feeling of content mentor conversely the extent to which they experience feelings of unhappiness and depressive symptoms – did not explain variance observed in the quality of their interactions with the children beyond other predictors as outlined in the introduction earlier studies did find the personal characteristics of their adult caregivers and the reported depressive symptoms in particular to be important determinants of caregiver child interactions both in parents and in professional caregivers possibly the general mood subscale of the eq i that we used in the present study captures too little of the negative mood spectrum to also assess the effect of the caregivers depressive symptoms
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,"Given the high incidence of depression among professional caregivers in child care centers (Fish, Lietzow, Casey, & brock dorff 2005), future studies into the multiple determinants of professional caregiving should also include more sensitive measures of depression"
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,furthermore future studies are recommended to also include personality characteristics that have earlier been found to predict the quality of parenting such as ego resilience (Van Bakel & riksenwalraven2002or the big five personality dimensions belsky bare nds2002kochanskaetal2004
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,although the caregivers self reported general mood did not predict the quality of their caregiving their age did a higher age coincided with a higher quality of care beyond other predictors the lunchtime and overall interactions the older caregivers had with the children were superior to those of the younger caregivers
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,"However, this was not the case for the structured play interval which reflects that the older staff performed better during everyday activities and natural interactions with the children but apparently not during the more educational activities the association between caregiver age and quality of care may be accounted for by differences in job motivation between older and younger employees."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,traditionally staff turnover rates are high among care providers in child care centers (see also lamb1998vandellwolfe2000 probably because caring for groups of young children is a strenuous job that does not pay all that well and offers few career opportunities hence caregivers who stay on longer or start working at a later age may be more intrinsically motivated for the work involved than their younger colleagues
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,11,This was confirmed by our inspection of the associations between caregiver age and the separate items of the cis among the highest correlating items were seems to enjoy the children r26p01 and seems distant or detached from the children r20p01 nevertheless we do not rule out other potential explanations for the observed relationship between age and quality of caregiver child interactions and further research is clearly warranted

Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,"Remarkably and contrary to our expectations the other two child care group characteristics ie child caregiver ratio and group size did not predict the quality of caregiving these characteristics have explicitly been established as major determinants of the quality of care in numerous studies in various countries lamb1998vandellwolfe2000 indeed in a previous study with the current sample we found that an experi mental manipulation of the child caregiver ratio 31versus51 significantly affected the quality of caregiver child interactions during the structured play session (De Schipper, rik sen walraven & Geurts, 2006)."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,The present study showed neither the child caregiver ratio nor the group size to predict the quality of the caregiver child interactions in neither of the two more natural situations lunchtime and cis overall observations given that these factors also proved unrelated to the quality of caregiving in other studies conducted in child care centers in the netherlands van ij zen door netal1998vermeeretal2005 our present finding may be typical for the dutch situation then again the distributions of the scores for ratio and group size in the present sample could also have underlain the absence of an association but inspection of the relevant means and sdsintable2 shows that the dutch values do not substantially differ from those reported for other countries cfvandellwolfe2000 moreover comparison of relevant charac teristics of the present sample to those of a representative sample of dutch child care centers vermeer etal2005 showed no striking differences in variables such as child caregiver ratio caregiver age experience or education the centers years of existence which also supports the validity of our findings
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,A typically Dutch factor that might be relevant is that in the netherlands center based child care is traditionally interpreted as care rather than education little attention is paid to educational activities and the educational quality of dutch child care centers is consequently low compared to the quality in other countries gevers dey noot schaub rik sen walraven 2005vermeeretal2005if group size and child caregiver ratio matter more during educational activities than during everyday routines and the free play intervals which is plausible the lack of educational activities in the dutch child care centers would explain why these two factors were unrelated to the quality of caregiver child interactions in our study
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,Against our expectations the levels of perceived occupational workload and support did not substantially con- tribute to the quality of the caregivers interactions with their children.
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,"For the various types of stressors at work only the caregivers subjective physical workload was found to independently and negatively affect the quality of their caregiving the physical aspects of the job clearly affected the care they provided more than the mental and emotional factors support from colleagues and supervisors proved wholly unrelated theoretically the near absence of associations might be due to our measures lacking validity to assess support and workload, but several findings speak against this argument the instrument vbb a we used to assess work characteristics is well established and has proven validity (for a review, see Van Veldhoven, De Jonge, Broersen, Kompier, & Meijman, 2002)."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,"More- over, the various measures for occupational workload and support were meaningfully related to other contextual and personal characteristics (see Table 1), which further supports the validity of our findings."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,apparently the role support from colleagues and supervisors plays in determining the quality of care for young children in child care centers is less important than the role marital support has in determining the quality of parenting in the home setting.
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,"It may be concluded from the findings reported in this study, that the determinants of professional caregiving do not seem to correspond well with the determinants of parenting a similar conclusion was drawn by a hne rtp in quart and lamb2006 in their meta analysis on child caregiver attachments in professional childcare where they stated that the factors shaping the quality of child care provider relationships in these contexts differ from those known to shape child mother attachments (p. 674)."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,"How, then, do the determinants of the quality of professional child care identified in the present study differ from those that have been found to shape the quality of parenting we tentatively conclude that in professional caregiving settings the predictors are less socio emotional and more professional in nature than the predictors of parental care in the home situation professional care levels proved not associated with the caregivers general mood nor with the support they received from others in the workplace or with emotional and mental workload while similar factors have been found to play a key role in determining the quality of care the parents provide belskybarends2002 this is consistent with the findings constantino and olesh1999 reported they found their professional caregivers security of attachment representations also not to be related to the quality of the care provided whereas the effect of such security on parental caregiving had previously been extensively documented"
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,12,The authors explained the disparity in findings by the higher level of emotional involvement that is characteristic of the parent child relationship and not typical of the relationship between professional caregivers and the children
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,324 ej de schipper et al early childhood research quarterly 222007312326 in their care.
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,"In sum, constantino and Olesh’s explanation may also apply to the current results as in our study the personal factors affected the quality of professional caregiving far less than the more structural or regula table factors such as the level of physical workload in our case, and caregiver wages, which were found to be among the most powerful predictors in many earlier studies lamb1998vandellwolfe2000 it needs to be noted that because the remuneration of professional caregivers in child care centers are quite uniform in the netherlands we did not include this factor as a potential determinant"
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,Another striking finding of the present study – which supports the assumption discussed above regarding the professional nature of the determinants of professional caregiving is that the predictors of the quality of professional caregiving explained more variance at the level of the child care centers than at the level of the individual caregivers
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,"this seems to imply that certain facets pertaining to the center in which the caregivers work may also partly determine or account for the differences in the quality of care they provide although the aspects we examined ie center size and years of existence were not related to the quality of care a possible candidate is the educational level of the parents whose child or children attend a particular child care center lower levels of parental education are associated with more developmental and behavioral problems in the children who may hence be difficult to deal with which consequently may negatively affect the quality of the caregiver child interactions (see Vandell & Wolfe, 2000)."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,"However, such a selection effect is highly unlikely to occur in the netherlands because center based child care is predominantly used by parents with more advanced schooling and because selection of centers based on quality is very difficult given the lack of valid national quality indicators gevers dey noot schaubriksenwalraven2005 in a previous study in dutch child care centers the lack of such a selection effect was also found gevers dey noot schaubriksenwalraven2006"
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,"to shed more light on the between center differences in the quality of the caregiver child interactions we observed other workplace characteristics that directly affect the caregivers (e.g., ergonomic facilities for the caregivers their working hours, selection policy for caregivers or educational orientation of the child care center) warrant further investigation"
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,The presumed absence of the above mentioned selection effect was also the reason why we did not include tem- per a mental characteristics or other indicators of difficult ness of individual children such as behavioral problems as possible predictors of the quality of caregiver behavior we simply assumed more difficult children to be randomly distributed across caregivers and therefore to not explain variance in the quality of caregiver behavior but this assump tion remained untested in the present study which may be considered a limitation future studies and certainly studies in countries where selection effects are at work should also take characteristics of individual children into account as an indicator of the difficult ness of a care group if a selection effect is indeed the case which implies that parents with less difficult children select higher quality child care for their children a measure for difficult ness of the care group based on the difficult ness of individual children can be expected to explain variance in the quality of caregiver behavior particularly at the level of the centers
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,"although the results are not very strong and more research is definitely needed to corroborate our findings and to determine their generalizability to other countries and different childcare contexts the findings of the present study have implications for policy and practice first the clear and consistent positive association between child age and the quality of professional caregiving that was found in the present study underscores the need to pay special attention to the quality of child care for the youngest children, that is, the infants."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,"This was recently confirmed in another observational study in dutch child care centers which showed caregiver sensitivity toward 3to6 month old infants to be clearly inadequate for a substantial number of children (Albers, rik sen walraven & de Weerth, in press)."
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,As shown in an earlier study on the present sample de schipper riksenwalravengeurts2006 merely improving caregiver child ratios may be an effective measure to enhance the quality of care provided to infants in child care centers providing specialized training to professional caregivers working with infants may also be useful in countries such as the netherlands with an educational system that does not prepare caregivers specifically to working with very young children
Multiple determinants of caregiver behavior in child care centers.pdf,13,the positive association between the physical workload reported by caregivers and the quality of their caregiving suggests that improvement of the work environment and conditions for the caregivers may also facilitate the provision of higher quality caregiving given that it is the physical workload that is related to the caregiving quality improvement of ergonomic facilities in particular may be expected to lead to improvement of caregiving but given the correlational nature of the data and the fact that this study is the first to take into account the work conditions of professional child care providers in predicting the quality of their caregiving the empirical evidence in this area is too limited to afford more specific implications for childcare practice and policy

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,A total of 179 children (ages 3–6) from three mixed-age classes and three same-age classes were involved in this study.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"A total of 170 valid videos were obtained, including 85 videos from the mixed-age (M = 58.99 months, age SD = 10.09, 34% girls) classrooms and 85 from the same-age (M = 57.74 months, age SD = 10.84, 43% girls) classrooms"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,The results revealed that: (1) there was a significant age effect in the frequency and duration of peer interactions with older children having more and longer interactions (2) there was a significant between group difference in the duration of peer interactions with MA having a longer duration than SA; (3) there was a significant same gender preference with children preferring interacting with the same gender peers; (4) the MA classrooms had significantly more positive interactions and significantly less neutral and negative interactions than the SA classrooms and (5) the MA class- rooms engaged in significantly more dominating and less neutral interactions than the SA ones.

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"Peer interactions provide opportunities for young children to gain social practice and experience and to build healthy peer relationships thus, they will eventually and profoundly impact their socio- emotional development (Blerta, 2019)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,Peer interactions include those interactions between same-age peers as well as between mixed-age peers.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"However, most preschool classrooms in the world are arranged by age, thus only having same-age peer interactions which are an important part of the daily routine in early childhood programs."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,consequently young children in the same-age classrooms will be suffering from the lacking of mixed-age peer interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"This problem is more serious in China, as it has implemented the only-child policy for 30 years and has made most Chinese children the only child in their families (Li et al., 2020)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"This means that these Chinese only children have been deprived of the opportunities of having mixed-age peer interactions at home and in preschool, which will unfortu- nately and negatively impact their social development (Zhang, 2004)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"Recently, some Chinese pre- schools are trying to promote mixed-age classrooms thus providing mixed-age peer interactions (Wu, 2017)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"However, there might be significant differences in the peer interaction patterns between mixed- age (MA) and same-age (SA) preschool classrooms (Wu, 2017)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,2,"accordingly there is an urgent need to explore the similarities and differences in the two types of peer interaction in the Chinese context, thus providing educational implications for implementing the mixed-age classroom policy in China."

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Positive peer interactions can help children gain a sense of belonging and security, thus promoting their social communication skills (Ryan, 2012) and psychological adaptability (Boivin, 2005)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,The existing studies on peer interaction tend to focus on the value of peer interactions the characteristics of peer interactions factors that influence peer interaction and peer interaction skills intervention training.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"It is believed that if educators are sufficiently equipped to support peer interactions within MA or SA classrooms it would be possible to maximize the positive peer influence (DeLay et al., 2016; Foster et al., 2020)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"The importance of peer interaction could be interpreted using Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory (SCT), which views interaction as a necessary tool for creating a ZPD (zone of proximal development of a particular learner (Tomas, 2019)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"According to SCT, young children could develop cognitively and socially through peer interactions (Vygotsky, 1978)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"As peer interactions can facilitate young chil- dren’s learning and development in many domains, it is important, theoretically and practically to understand how peer interactions differ in mixed-age (MA) and same-age (SA) preschool classrooms"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Thus, this study reveals the differences in young children’s peer interactions within MA and SA classrooms and the potential reasons for these differences and proposes pedagogical recommendations for supporting peer interactions among young children."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Mixed-Age versus Same-Age Preschool Classrooms Preschool classrooms are normally same-aged (SA), very few are mixed-aged (MA)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"In MA preschool classrooms young children of varying ages and developmental levels are placed together following a specific combination model (Katz, 1992)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,MA classroom promotes the development of self esteem and self confidence in older children by providing them with the opportunity to care for younger children.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"In contrast, younger children are empowered to identify their zone of proximal development and engage in activities beyond their cognitive levels."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"In addition, older children serve as role models for younger children, thereby inducing younger children to exhibit prosocial behaviors in future interactions with even younger children (Ansari & Purtell, 2018; Lillard, 2016; Winsler et al., 2002)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Thus, MA preschool classrooms can help facilitate peer interaction enhancing young children’s social and personality development"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"SA preschool classrooms have the same-aged young children, who are very likely to have a similar level of knowledge, competencies and relational power."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"This also provides a unique environment for children to resolve cognitive conflicts with peers, thereby stimulating their social cognitive, and moral developments (Azmitia, 1988; Piaget, 1932; Tudge, 1992)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"In contrast, MA preschool classrooms might increase the hierarchical structure and level of complexity in group interactions while SA classrooms might have relatively equal and comparable young children around the same level."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Therefore, peer interactions in MA classrooms can provide opportunities for older children to practice and develop prosocial, self regulatory and leadership skills, while younger children gain scaffolds for growth as they receive help from older children (Winsler et al., 2002)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Compared to those in SA classrooms young children in MA classrooms have more play styles, more prosocial behaviors, and tend to depend on peers rather than teachers in daily routine (Howes & Farver, 1987; Mounts & roop narine 1987)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"Therefore, MA and SA preschool classrooms have different benefits for young children."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,Early child- hood teachers need to capitalize on the benefits of peer interactions in different preschool classrooms to facilitate young children’s early learning and development
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,3,"In the past decade, researchers have focused on exploring the frequency, features, and factors of peer interactions in MA preschool classrooms (Ansari & Purtell, 2018; Lillard, 2016)."

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"EARLY EDUCATION & development 543 focus has gradually shifted to the impact of MA on young children’s learning and development (Foster et al., 2020)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"The existing literature has collectively demonstrated that MA classrooms could enable peer support among children and facilitate early cognitive and social development (Ansari & Purtell, 2018; Lillard, 2016)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"However, few studies have explored the unique impact of MA on only children in the Chinese context."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"Unlike their counterparts in other countries, the young children in China are primarily only-child in their families thus have no experiences of peer interaction at home (Li et al., 2020)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"Chinese young children might have unique peer interaction patterns in MA preschool class- rooms, as interacting with an elder or younger children might be rare."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,This study will fill this research gap.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,This Study The above literature review has revealed two research gaps.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"First, no studies have examined the peer interactions in MA and SA preschool classrooms in China, where most young children have no siblings thus have no experience of peer interactions at home."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"Second, very few studies have revealed the differences and similarities in peer interactions between MA and SA classrooms especially in Chinese preschoolers"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"Given that more and more preschools are implementing MA classroom policy in China, it is urgently needed to conduct a classroom observational study to compare MA and SA classrooms peer interaction patterns."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,This will generate empirical evidence to showcase the nuanced differences between MA and SA classrooms and their impacts on peer interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"Therefore, this study was dedicated to addressing the following questions with videotaped observations (1) Will the children in MA classrooms outperform those in SA classrooms in peer interactions in frequency and duration?"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,(2) Will the children in MA and SA classrooms differ in the peer interaction patterns in terms of peer relationship and group structure?
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,In particular we proposed the following hypotheses H1: The children in MA classrooms will demonstrate longer duration and more frequency of peer interactions than their counterparts in SA classrooms H2: The children in MA classrooms will have better peer relationships and group structure than their counterparts in SA classrooms
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"Method participants A cluster sampling approach was adopted to recruit 179 children from three mixed-age (MA) and three same-age (SA) classes in a Chinese kindergarten located in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,Chinese kindergarten normally has three levels of class: (1) Lower kindergarten Class (Xiaoban) for Aged 3–4 children; (2) Middle kindergarten Class (Zhongban) for Aged 4–5 children; and (3) Upper kindergarten Class (Daban) for Aged 5–6 children.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,The participating kindergarten has one MA and two SA classrooms for each level.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,We randomly sampled one SA classroom and the only MA classroom from each level.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,Each of the three MA classes was composed of children from the other two levels.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,4,"A total of 170 valid videos were obtained, with 85 from the MA classes (M = 58.99 months, age SD = 10.09, 34% girls) and 85 from the SA classes (M = 57.74 months, SD = 10.84, 43% girls)."

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,5,"One week before collecting data in the participating classroom, we videotaped and interacted with the participating children to eliminate the children’s feelings of unfamiliarity with the camera and us."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,5,This scenario based familiarization technique will help to ensure data authenticity and validity.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,5,"Second, we videotaped all the participating children when they played with peers during the free playtime."

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,7,"As shown in Figure 2, these results indicated that MA classrooms had significantly more positive interactions and significantly less neutral and negative interactions than the SA classrooms"

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,Discussion As the first exploration of peer interaction patterns in Chinese preschoolers this study found some similarities and differences between MA and SA classrooms
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,significant age differences were found in the frequency and time duration of peer interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"And the MA classrooms had a significantly longer duration, more active initiative and dominating interactions than the SA classrooms support- ing both hypotheses proposed in this study."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,This section will discuss these findings and their implications for early childhood education.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,The Age Effect in Peer interactions This study found a significant age effect in the frequency and duration of peer interactions with older children having more and longer interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,This age effect could be caused by the interactions between social and cognitive development and learning experience
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"First, the time between ages 3 and 6 might be the critical period for young children’s social and cognitive development (Vygotsky, 1978)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,Young children will undergo the de egocentric process to depart from their egocentric thought from age 4–5.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"According to Piaget, the Lower Class children are still egocentric thus cannot see situations from other’s perspectives (Piaget, 2001)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,They tend to engage in solitary or parallel play and are not proactive in peer interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"The de egocentric processing however, has gradually driven the young children to think about and from other’s perspectives and to understand others’ intentions and emotions, getting them ready for peer interactions"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"accordingly in the Upper Class (ages 5–6), young children tend to have de egocentric thought, role taking perspec- tives, theory of mind, and cooperative social skills (Ronald et al., 2005), the essentials for peer interactions"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"Second, young children tend to have more chances and experiences interacting with peers when they have longer pre schooling time."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,This pre schooling experience will broaden their circles of interaction and facilitate their learning and development of social skills.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,accordingly they will learn more social strategies and have more opportunities for practising these strategies
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"This will transform their peer interactions from simple verbal ones or exchange materials to joint planning, negotiation and cooperation"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"consequently older children would have more and longer peer interactions in the late preschool years (Göncü, 1993)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,MA Classrooms with More and Longer Peer interactions This study found a significant difference between the MA and SA classrooms in the duration of peer interactions with MA classes having a longer duration.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,This group difference could be caused by the unique structure and strength of the mixed-age arrangement
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"First, the structure of MA classrooms is the mixture of children from Lower (ages 3–4), Middle (ages 4–5), and Upper (ages 5–6) levels."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,The peer interactions will normally involve a pair of mixed- age children.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"In the dyad peer interactions the older child will naturally take responsibility for taking care of their younger peer, who tends to imitate the older one’s speech and behavior."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"In most cases, the younger child is very eager to play with the older peer and wishes to interact with the latter as long as possible."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,All these structural features have jointly increased the frequency and duration of peer interactions in the MA classrooms
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"Second, MA classrooms strength is that the elder one is usually more experienced or skillful in peer interactions possesses a more advanced theory of mind, and tends to utilize appropriate strategies for social interactions (Ansari & Purtell, 2018)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,"In contrast, the younger on in MA classrooms especially those only children who have no siblings at home, have been longing for social interactions with elder ones."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,9,accordingly the MA classrooms are more beneficial to peer interactions thus tend to have more and longer peer interactions than the SA classrooms
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"EARLY EDUCATION & development 549 between group differences in the Five Constructs of Peer interactions First, this study found that the young children preferred to play with same gender peers in both MA and SA classrooms"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"This finding indicated that the Chinese young children were more likely to choose and interact with the same gender peers, regardless of age and class type."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"This same gender preference has been explored by Strough and Covatto (2002), who examined the age and gender preference for peer interactions in primary and middle school students."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,They found that this same gender preference varied by context: students demonstrated same gender preference when working on a project at school but not when interacting casually at home.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,especially those primary students indicated greater same- gender preference
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"However, their study did not involve preschoolers"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,This study has extended their finding about the same gender preference to Chinese preschoolers
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,nevertheless future studies are needed to verify this phenomenon with large scale and representative data.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"Second, this study found that the MA classrooms had significantly more positive interactions and significantly less neutral and negative interactions than the SA classrooms"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,This might be caused by the mixed-age arrangement in which elder ones tend to be more supportive and considerate thus give more positive interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"With more and more pre schooling experiences elder children have been nurtured with a sense of collectivism thus tend to consider more from others, especially those younger than them."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"This is consistent with the existing finding that elder children tend to be de egocentric (Vygotsky, 1978) and more collective cooperative and collaborative (Rubin, 2009)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"Therefore, young children in the MA classrooms would have more positive and less negative interactions than their counterparts in SA classrooms"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"Third, this study found that the MA classrooms engaged in significantly more dominating and less neutral interactions than the SA ones."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"This might be because the elder children in MA classrooms possess advanced cognitive and social abilities and skills than their younger peers, thus playing a dominating role in peer interactions"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"The dyad of elder girl and younger boy is a typical “big sister little brother” group, in which the “big sister” would take for granted to play the leading and even dominating role, directing and controlling the course and direction of peer interactions"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"In contrast, the paired children in SA classrooms have no age differences thus possess similar abilities and skills."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"In the peer interactions the initiator has no age related advantages thus has to adopt more peer equally strategies such as the rock paper scissors game, to solve the conflicts and problems."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"However, this study found no significant differences between the MA and SA classrooms in the constructs of initiative and “method”."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,This might be because the mixed-age arrangement might not cause any significant differences in the frequency and duration of peer interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,nevertheless further studies are needed to follow up with these two constructs
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"conclusions limitations and implications In summary, this study found that: (1) there was a significant age effect in the frequency and duration of peer interactions with older children having more and longer interactions (2) there was a significant difference between the MA and SA classrooms in the duration of peer interactions with MA classes having a longer duration; (3) there was a significant same gender preference with children in both MA and SA classrooms preferring interacting with the same gender peers; (4) the MA classrooms had significantly more positive interactions and significantly less neutral and negative interactions than the SA classrooms and (5) the MA classrooms engaged in significantly more dominating and less neutral interactions than the SA ones."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"However, this study has some major limitations"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"First, this study was only based on 10-minute videotaped classroom observation for each participating child, which might not be adequate in quantity and quality."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"To thoroughly understand the real situation of peer interactions longer time observation over varying scenarios such as group learning, outdoor activities should be conducted in the future."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,"Second, this study was conducted in only one Chinese kindergarten thus, the results could not be generalized to represent all the Chinese children."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,10,Future studies would benefit from a larger
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,550 J. WU ET AL.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,sample from more cities in the country.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"Third, this is a typical observational study; thus, its findings have not been verified by other measures."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"In the future, data triangulation (including parents, teachers, and children) and method triangulation observation interview, and survey) should be established to consolidate the reliability and validity of the findings."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,nevertheless these findings have meaningful implications for early childhood education.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"First, young children should be given adequate time for peer interactions which will help them understand other’s perspectives and learn to solve conflicts."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"Second, teachers should consider adopting the mixed- age approach to engage young children in more and longer peer interactions"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,In particular teachers could encourage the elder ones to play the “big sister” or “big brother” roles to lead and even teach their “litter brother” or “littler sister” in the peer interactions
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"Meanwhile, teachers could also encourage younger ones to seek help from their older peers who are more capable and experienced"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,This will make both the elder one feeling more productive while the younger one feeling more comfortable
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,accordingly peer interactions could become a pleasant social learning journey.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"Third, teachers should learn how to establish and manage mixed-age classrooms to maximize their strengths and benefits."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"At least, they should acquire the teaching skills relevant to environmental support, interactional catalyst, and interactional guidance (Zhang, 2009)."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,"Finally, teachers could use interaction scenarios in group teaching to engage young children in collective role-play, which will let young children experience different interactive behaviors and the corresponding outcomes."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,11,In the following conversational and reflection activities teachers could invite more recollection of events related to the peer interactions and facilitate their understanding of peer and social relationships

Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,It includes same- gender and opposite gender.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,It can be distinguished by the gender of focal and engaged children.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Construct II: Initiative (active, passive) interaction initiative refers to whether the interaction is initiated by the focal child or not."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,It includes active initiation and passive initiation
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,Active initiation means focal child start the interaction first.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"For instance, focal child invited engaged child to the interaction by means of oral invitation patting or laughing to the engaged child, etc."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,During the interaction the reactions of focal child are positive and active.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,Passive initiation means that engaged child starts the interaction with focal child.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"For example, when focal child is play toy bricks alone, engaged child come and say “let us build a train” or grab focal child’s bricks, whereas focal child generally keep silent and sometimes passively onlooking during the process of the interaction"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Construct III: Method (talk, action, or facial expression interaction method refers to the means of interaction which includes talk, action, and facial expression interaction"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Talk interaction means that focal child use verbal language to interact, e.g., tell the engaged child that “I like toy car very much”."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"It should be noted that self-talk without any engaged child should not be categorized as talk interaction for example, focal child with a feeder talk to toy baby that “come, Mom will feed you some milk”, or focal child yelling to him herself in free play."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,Both action and facial expression interactions are nonverbal.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Action interaction refers to interact with action, e.g., pat or touch engaged child."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Facial expression interaction refers to interact with expressions e.g., smile or stare with interest to engaged child."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Construct IV: Attitude (positive, neutral, or negative) interaction attitude refer to the nature of interaction regardless of the initiator."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"It can be classified as positive, neutral, and negative."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Positive interaction refers to the interaction with praise, appreciation acknowledgment encouragement support or cooperation"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"For example, focal child reassuring the crying child actively."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Negative interaction refers to interaction contains conflict, criticism, blaming, deny or punishment e.g., bulling or insulting another child."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,Neutral interaction refers to interaction without significant positive or negative nature.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"For example, focal child go to play toy bricks with others."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Construct IV: Control dominating neutral, or following) interaction control refers to the extent of dominance of focal child."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"It includes dominating neutral, and following interactions"
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,Dominating interaction refer to the interaction during which focal child take the dominating or leading role.
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"They assign roles or command others, e.g., focal child leading the group, command or impel other children such as “you must put it here” and other children obey his/her order."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"Following interaction refer to the interaction that focal child obey engaged child’s command, they almost do whatever others commands, merely express objection."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,"For instance, engaged child asked that “Let’s stop this game and play roleplay and focal child follow the command."
Peer Interaction Patterns in Mixed-Age and same age chinese kindergarten.pdf,13,The neutral interaction refers to the interaction during which focal child express neither obeying nor oppose intention to others.

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,additionally we examined the extent to which the physical literacy environment explained the associations between classroom age composition and emer- gent literacy outcomes.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,"We found that classrooms with a higher proportion of younger children (2- or 3 year olds provide less book use, writing materi- als, and writing around the room."

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,"Enrollment in high quality preschool education improves childhood outcomes such as emergent literacy acquisition which has implications for long-term school success (Crawford, 1995; Duncan et al., 2007; Pullen & Justice, 2003)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,"Among the many characteristics of a high quality preschool classroom, one important aspect is the physical literacy environment which is commonly defined by the reading and writing resources available in the classroom and how they are arranged (Altun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2012)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,"Examples of physical literacy materials include books, writing utensils, language based puzzles, and alphabet displays."

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,importantly recent studies have shown that characteristics of children in the classroom are predictive of the physical literacy environment
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,"For instance, Guo et al."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,2,(2013) found that preschool classrooms serving a higher percentage of dual language learners (DLLs) had a lower quality physical literacy environment

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,presumably children’s ages may also shape the ways in which teachers organize their classrooms and provide materials that support emergent literacy acquisition
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Therefore, in this study, we examine the extent to which: 1) classroom age composition is associated with the classrooms physical literacy environment and 2) classroom age composition is associated with children’s emergent literacy skill gains through the physical literacy environment"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,Inquiry into these questions has implications for optimizing classroom environments that can facilitate children’s emergent literacy learning in mixed-age classrooms
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Emergent Literacy Skills Emergent literacy highlights that the development of literacy starts from an early age prior to formal reading and writing instruction with the term emergent literacy skills referring to a variety of foundational skills that enable skilled and fluent reading and writing (Storch & whitehurst 2002; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"The current study focuses on four emergent literacy skills that have been highlighted as the key instructional focus in the preschool period: Receptive and expressive vocabulary and phonological awareness and print knowledge (Lonigan et al., 2011)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Although these four skills are moderately to highly correlated (Cabell et al., 2011; Storch & whitehurst 2002), they are also strong and independent predictors of reading and writing acquisition (Pullen & Justice, 2003)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"understanding and expressing vocabulary are skills strongly associated with early reading (Dickinson et al., 2019), with prior studies showing that weakness in receptive or expressive vocabu- lary is associated with early decoding difficulties and later reading difficulties (Lee, 2011; Ouellette, 2006)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"phonological awareness, defined as the sensitivity to and ability to manipulate sound structure, has also been found to be a significant predictor of reading skills (Castles & Coltheart, 2004; Kendeou et al., 2009)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Finally, children’s knowledge of the conventions and forms of written language, namely print knowledge, has been found to predict reading acquisition even after controlling for phonological awareness (Levy et al., 2006; National Early Literacy Panel, 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Preschool Physical Literacy environment and Children’s Emergent Literacy development Efforts to enhance children’s development through high quality preschool experiences have primarily focused on social interactions as emphasized by bronfenbrenner s bio ecological theory bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"However, research has shown inconsistent associations between preschool classroom social interactional quality and children’s emergent literacy skills burch in al 2016; Perlman et al., 2016)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"Thus, there have been calls for attention to other aspects of classroom experiences highlighted by bio ecological theory bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998), such as the objects and symbols available to children that play a unique and predictive role in their development (Wachs, 1990)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"One such aspect that has received increasing attention is the physical literacy environment (Altun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2012), which includes the availability display, and arrangement of literacy materials, such as books, print sources, and writing instruments (Altun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2012; wolfers berger et al., 2004)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"These calls reflect the fact that the literacy environment is not only predictive of children’s outcomes, but is more malleable than teachers’ social interactions markus sen Brown et al., 2017)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,When considering the physical literacy environment there are several theoretical explanations that shed light on how and why the physical literacy environment may shape children’s emergent literacy learning.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"bio ecological theory suggests that the organization structure, and complexity of the physical environment not only stimulates solitary interactions with objects and symbols, but also provides conditions and stimuli for interpersonal interactions involving literacy related instruction and mod- eling bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,3,"In addition, sociocultural theory emphasizes that children’s internalization and use of symbols and signs are first supported by the presence of props and object- orientated play, which involves physical interaction with objects and materials (Vygotsky, 1978)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"EARLY EDUCATION & development 3 Taken together, the physical literacy environment can directly elicit literacy related exploration manipulation elaboration and imagination in children’s solitary activities"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"It can also prompt adult- mediated literacy enriched play where teachers model and scaffold children’s use of physical literacy resources (Christie & Enz, 1992; Neuman & Roskos, 1993; Vukelich, 1991)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,There are several ways to characterize the classroom physical literacy environment
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Classrooms with a rich physical literacy environment have numerous and varied book materials, literacy areas, writing materials, and teacher- and child directed writing displays and props around the classroom."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"A high quality physical literacy environment includes books of varying difficulty levels and genres (e.g., rhyming texts, alphabet books, flap books), related to different curriculum themes, and are arranged in different activity centers (e.g., dramatic play areas, the block center, the science table; Justice, 2006)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"In addition, high quality classrooms provide designated areas with writing tools and materials that promote writing and model writing (e.g., newspapers maps; Guo et al., 2012; Neuman & Roskos, 1990), as well as examples of teacher- and child directed writing and print products used to guide daily learning experiences (e.g., signs, posters, writing samples; Guo et al., 2012; Phillips et al., 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Classrooms that are rich in literacy materials and areas have been found to increase the frequency, duration, and complexity of literacy related play (Neuman & Roskos, 1990, 1992)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"For example, children in intervention classrooms that were enriched with literacy objects in targeted play areas (e.g., the cozy corner library) were observed to spend more time engaging in reading and writing activities incorporate literacy objects in more diverse and functional ways, and use more explicit language than the non intervention group (Neuman & Roskos, 1992)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"In another study, classrooms with high quality classroom physical literacy environments were strongly associated with children’s general literacy interest and engagement in literacy activities"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"These factors, in turn, predicted their phonological awareness and expressive vocabulary (Baroody & Diamond, 2016)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,Several studies further demonstrate direct associations between the physical literacy environment and emergent literacy acquisition
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"For example, Arteaga et al."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,(2019) found a positive association between engaging with a high quality physical literacy environment and children’s print knowledge.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Similarly, other studies have found that the quality of the classroom literacy area is significantly associated with children’s alphabet knowledge and name writing abilities (Guo et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015) as well as expressive and receptive vocabulary and phonological awareness (Altun et al., 2018)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"These findings suggest that there are links between features of the physical literacy environment and children’s emergent literacy skills (Altun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2012; Palmer et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2014)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Despite promising evidence that the physical literacy environment is important for children’s early emergent literacy skills, there is limited research on factors that may shape the literacy environment"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"However, existing research suggests that the physical literacy environment is malleable."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"For example, interventions aimed at improving teachers’ language instruction and implementation of language- focused curricula have shown significant positive changes in the quality of the classroom literacy environment (Arteaga et al., 2019; Palmer et al., 2018)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Although promising, more inquiry is needed into what influences the classroom literacy environment and how those factors are related to young children’s emergent literacy skills."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,Classroom Age composition Classroom environment and Children’s Emergent Literacy development The importance and malleability of the physical literacy environment warrant more in-depth studies on what shapes it.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Although it is undoubtedly shaped by larger contextual forces (e.g., program funding), understanding more proximal predictors is also important."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,"Mirroring the bidirectional relations between a person and their context proposed by bio ecological theory bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998), the physical literacy environment can influence children’s emergent literacy learning while simultaneously being shaped by the collective characteristics of children within a classroom."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,4,These characteristics may influence teachers’ perceptions and beliefs about the developmental needs
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,4 Q. YANG ET AL.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"and interests of children, which in turn, influences their provision of a high quality physical literacy environment"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"For example, the classroom language composition (as measured by the percentage of DLLs within the classroom) has been found to be significantly associated with the quality of the physical literacy environment and instruction such that classrooms serving a larger proportion of DLLs were rated as having a lower quality literacy environment (Guo et al., 2013; Justice et al., 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Another notable feature of classrooms that may shape the literacy environment is the ages of children, commonly referred to as classroom age composition (Moller et al., 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Given the less formal regulations around preschool in the United States, mixed-age classrooms which include children of multiple age groups, are widely used."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"For example, according to national statistics over 75% of children in Head Start, the largest publicly funded preschool program in the United States, are enrolled in mixed-age classrooms serving both 3- and 4 year olds (Moiduddin et al., 2012)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"National data also reveal that roughly 65% of preschool classrooms including those in publicly funded programs, have over a 12-month age difference between the oldest and youngest children, with 35% reporting an age difference of 18 months or greater (National Survey of Early Care and Education, 2012)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"These findings underscore the considerable enrollment of preschoolers in mixed-age class- rooms, although the distribution of children in different age groups varies across states and programs (Ansari et al., 2016)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Therefore, the current study focuses on the variation in the percentage of children in each age group as indicators of classroom age composition"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Classroom age composition is an important factor to consider because it has been shown to shape children’s school performance including their acquisition of emergent literacy skills (e.g., Ansari et al., 2016; Justice et al., 2019; Moller et al., 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"A preliminary pattern identified in previous studies suggests that older children in classrooms with a higher proportion of younger peers may gain less in emergent literacy skills, corresponding to 2 to 5 months of academic development (Ansari et al., 2016)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"However, the mechanisms that link classroom age composition to children’s learning are still unclear."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,investigating the underlying mechanisms is essential given the prevalence of mixed-age classrooms and the variability in classroom age composition
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Moreover, the factors that link classroom age composition and children’s learning can inform interventions that seek to optimize children’s learning in mixed-age settings."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"As part of the current study, we propose that the classroom physical literacy environment may function as a potential mechanism through which classroom age composition shapes children’s emergent literacy learning."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,There is indirect evidence regarding links between classroom age compo- sition and teachers’ practices that lends support to this hypothesis
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"For example, Ansari and Pianta (2019) found that greater classroom age diversity creates challenges for teachers to provide children with high quality emotional and instructional support."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"As another example, teachers serving class- rooms with a larger proportion of younger children have been found to provide less opportunity for children to engage in group and academic instruction (Ansari, 2017)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Similarly, classroom age composition may also shape the classroom physical literacy environment due to teachers’ beliefs about young children’s literacy learning and development which is discussed below."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Preschool teachers may believe younger children do not need access to the same rich physical literacy environment compared to older children (Lynch, 2009)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"For example, a study of Head Start teachers revealed that teachers often believed that young children should only engage with literacy materials after mastering social behavioral skills, such as following directions abiding by classroom rules, and relating to peers (Powell et al., 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Teachers’ beliefs about the degree to which children should learn emergent literacy skills at young ages have been found to be positively associated with the amount of teachers’ language and literacy related instructional practices (Schachter et al., 2016)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"Therefore, teachers with the above mentioned beliefs may provide fewer literacy related materials and spaces when teach- ing in classrooms with a higher percentage of younger children."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,"For example, in a classroom with more 3 year olds teachers may provide books with less engaging and complex narratives and fewer writing materials (e.g., pencils, papers, word cards, templates and writing dis- played around the room (e.g., signs, posters, charts, and children’s writing displays)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,5,The
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,EARLY EDUCATION & development 5 lesser provision of literacy related materials and space in classrooms with more younger children may be especially distinct when it comes to writing related materials and space.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"There is evidence showing that although most teachers agreed with research concerning what language and literacy skills children should know in preschool, 30% did not believe that children as young as three years old should learn to write without worrying about spelling knowledge or that these children learn to write by watching teachers write (Hindman & Wasik, 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"However, the above mentioned beliefs are contrary to the emergent literacy related research and theories which have established that children as young as three years of age are able to develop emergent literacy skills (Puranik & Lonigan, 2011; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998)."

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,Given the potential variation in classroom physical literacy environments based on the ages of children within the classroom and their influence on children’s emergent literacy development we hypothesize that classroom physical literacy environments may mediate the associations between classroom age composition and children’s emergent literacy development
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"The Current Study Given the importance and malleability of the classroom physical literacy environment for children’s emergent literacy learning, it is critical to investigate the factors that may influence it."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"Because children’s characteristics including age may shape teachers’ beliefs and practices about what to provide in the classroom environments (Ansari, 2017; Guo et al., 2013), we focus on classroom age composi- tion as one potential factor that influences the physical literacy environment"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,"additionally because the physical literacy environment has been theoretically and empirically suggested as a predictor of children’s literacy learning (Altun et al., 2018; bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006), we also examine aspects of the physical literacy environment as potential mediators that may explain associations between classroom age composition and children’s emergent literacy outcomes (Ansari et al., 2016; Moller et al., 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,specifically we examine: (1) the extent to which classroom age composition is associated with the classroom physical literacy environment and (2) whether the classroom physical literacy environment accounts for the associations between classroom age composition and children’s emergent literacy acquisition
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,6,We hypothesize that children may gain less in emergent literacy skills in classrooms with a higher percentage of younger peers as teachers may fail to provide a high quality and age appropriate physical literacy environment for them.

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,12,A test of the 40 mediating pathways through classroom physical literacy environment only revealed two significant indirect pathways (see Table 3).
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,12,"specifically children in classrooms with a higher proportion of younger peers compared to same-age peers were less likely to be exposed to writing around the classroom, which in turn, was associated with less optimal gains in expressive vocabulary (B = −0.013, p indirect < .05)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,12,"conversely classrooms with more older children compared with younger children had higher gains in expressive vocabulary in part because of more writing displayed around the classroom (B = 0.02, p < .05)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,12,"indirect Discussion understanding how the classroom environment shapes emergent literacy skills is critical, as these skills are among the strongest predictors of later reading skills and long-term school success (Crawford, 1995; Duncan et al., 2007; Pullen & Justice, 2003)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,12,"The current study focused on the classroom physical literacy environment as it represents one critical aspect of classroom structural environment that is not only more feasible to change compared to process quality but also has been shown to be strongly associated with children’s emergent literacy development (e.g., Altun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2012; Palmer et al., 2018)."

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,13,"These findings align with prior literature that document negative associations between the proportion of younger children (or within classroom variability of children’s ages) with classroom emotional and instructional support and time spent in group and academic instruction (Ansari, 2017; Ansari & Pianta, 2019)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,13,"We extended prior work by demonstrating that the age composition of classrooms shapes another important aspect of the classroom context, namely the physical literacy environment"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,13,Our findings on the negative associations between the proportion of younger children with writing materials and writing around room may be explained by teachers’ beliefs and knowledge of children’s reading and writing skill development

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"EARLY EDUCATION & development 13 areas, provide fewer writing materials, and organize less writing activities in classrooms with a higher percentage of 2-or 3 year olds because they design the physical literacy environment according to their understanding of the “needs” of younger children (Hindman & Wasik, 2008; Powell et al., 2008)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"However, these beliefs and practices may not be developmentally appropriate as studies have shown that children as young as 3 have the capacity to develop writing knowledge and skills, including organizing writing units marks in straight lines, using spaces to separate words, and applying accurate directionality while writing (Puranik & Lonigan, 2011)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"Inadequate book use, writing materials, and evidence of writing activities in classrooms with a higher proportion of younger children are potentially problematic because these aspects of the physical literacy environment have been shown to benefit emergent literacy learning for children across all age groups (Altun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2012; Palmer et al., 2018)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,accordingly these findings underscore the importance of teacher profes- sional development targeting knowledge about what young children need for developing emergent literacy skills and providing a quality physical literacy environment within mixed-age classrooms
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"Next, we found that writing around the room partially accounts for the association between classroom age composition and children’s gains in expressive vocabulary"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,specifically children in classrooms with a higher proportion of younger peers compared to same-age or older-age peers demonstrated smaller gains in expressive vocabulary partially due to fewer provision of writing activities
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"Although some studies have suggested older children may gain less in emergent literacy skills when entering mixed age classrooms with a large proportion of younger peers (e.g., Ansari et al., 2016; Moller et al., 2008), the mechanism underlying this association remains unclear."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,The current study sought to address this gap in knowledge by examining the role of the classroom physical literacy environment
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"Our findings suggest that 4 year olds in classrooms with a greater number of younger classmates may be exposed to fewer writing displays and evidence of writing related activities in their classrooms which in turn, is associated with their smaller gains in expressive vocabulary skills."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"specifically seeing more writing (e.g., posters, signs, teacher and child writing samples) around the classroom may create more prompts for children to practice and learn expressive vocabulary because these writings are usually designed to enrich children’s learning experiences in either a way related to the classroom theme or to children’s daily life."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"In addition, writing around the room, especially child- directed writing displays, can be viewed as evidence of writing related activities (Quinn et al., 2022), which also provide children with opportunities to learn different vocabulary (Zhang et al., 2015)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"Given that the physical literacy environment is highly malleable markus sen brown et al., 2017), providing age appropriate literacy materials and investing in the physical literacy environment may be a feasible approach to ensure 4 year olds acquire emergent literacy skills in mixed-age classrooms"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"However, we did not find evidence of mediation for the other emergent literacy outcomes, including receptive vocabulary phonological awareness, and print knowledge."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"Overall, the associa- tions between the five indicators of physical literacy environment and these outcomes were small in magnitude."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"These small and nonsignificant associations do not imply that physical literacy environ- ments are not important for children’s receptive vocabulary phonological awareness, and print knowledge learning as previous studies have documented such associations (Altun et al., 2018; Baroody & Diamond, 2016)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"One potential explanation is that physical literacy environments may shape the learning of these skills only when combined with high quality instruction and scaffolding (Guo et al., 2012)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,Future studies can investigate how classroom physical literacy environment and teacher child literacy related interactions in this environment interactively shape children’s emergent literacy learning.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,"Lastly, our results revealed that other aspects of physical literacy environments (i.e., book area, book selection, book use, and writing materials) did not play a mediating role in the associations between classroom age composition and children’s emergent literacy development"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,14,The failure to detect a mediating effect is potentially because our measure of physical literacy environments only assessed the presence and quantity of literacy related areas and materials without capturing children’s engage- ment.

Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"However, the results of this investigation need to be interpreted in light of several limitations"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"First, the sample of this study was drawn from either Head Start or public preschool programs in eight states, which limits the generalizability of our findings in other populations"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,Our findings are also not applicable to Montessori classrooms which follow a different type of curriculum and use specifically designed materials montessori 2004).
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"That said, our sample represented an ethnically and geographically diverse population of children with low- income backgrounds which increases the implications of our findings for publicly funded programs."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Second, we only focused on emergent literacy outcomes of 4 year olds in these programs due to the design of the larger study."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Since 3 year olds and 5 year olds may have different developmental needs and interests and respond to the physical literacy environment differently from 4 year olds (Pezoa et al., 2019), our findings on the mediating role of the physical literacy environment may not apply to these two age groups."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"However, studies show that low quality physical literacy environments have negative ramifications on the emergent literacy development of children in all age groups (Altun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2012; Palmer et al., 2018)."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Thus, 3 year olds and 5 year olds may also underperform due to an insufficient literacy environment in classrooms with a higher proportion of younger children."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Given the limited and mixed findings on the learning outcomes of these two age groups in previous studies (Guo et al., 2014; Justice et al., 2019), more work on how the physical literacy environment influences the learning of these children in mixed-age contexts is needed."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Third, the measure of literacy environment in this study mainly captures how teachers set up literacy related materials and areas, without reflecting how teachers and children interact with these environments"
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,nevertheless the ELLCO provides information on multiple aspects of physical literacy environment and has been widely used in relevant studies.
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,Despite our study providing preliminary evidence on the associations between classroom age composition and the literacy environment more in-depth observations on classroom literacy activities are needed to further elucidate children’s emergent literacy learning experiences in mixed-age classrooms
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Moreover, the original study did not collect data on the exact ages of all children within each classroom; thus, our measure of age composition generated from teacher reported numbers of children in each age group may be subject to measurement errors and mask the heterogeneity of children’s ages within each age group."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Lastly, even though we controlled for an extensive set of covariates including children’s baseline emergent literacy skills, causal inference cannot be generated given the correlational nature of the current study."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"implications and Conclusion With these limitations and future directions in mind, this study provides much needed insight into how mixed-age classroom contexts shape children’s literacy learning environments and outcomes."
Preschool Classroom Age Composition and Physical Literacy Environment  Influence on Children s Emergent Literacy Outcomes.pdf,15,"Our findings revealed that the physical literacy environment varies by classroom age composition in a way that classrooms with a higher proportion of younger children may provide less book use, writing materials, and writing around the room."

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,"Vygotsky (1934/462, 193019351978 saw the young child's use of private speech as representing the very significant period in development when language begins to be used by the child not only for communication but also as a means of self- guidance and self direction"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,"The primary function of private speech, therefore, according to Vygotsky, is self regulation"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,Private speech was seen by Vygotsky as a manifestation of the child's developing integration of thought and language as the child's social speech gradually becomes internalized to form inner verbal thought.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,"This progression from social speech to private speech, and ultimately to verbal thought, is viewed as an important developmental outcome which enables the child to engage in all forms of higher human psychological functioning (i.e., voluntary selective attention, metacognition voluntary menv ry, planning)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,"Through the use and internalization of private speech, young children, whose interactions with the world were once limited to rigid and unreflective reactions to stimuli, are able to gain distance from the concrete stimulus field and function at a more executive or intentional level (Diaz, Neal, & Amaya- Williams, 1990)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,"If indeed, as Vygotsky's theory suggests, private speech is a tool for self regulation then young children's use of private speech would be expected to vary in pred r:table ways depending on the child's activity and the surrounding physical and social context, rather than simply occurring randomly as an epi phenomenal event."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,More specifically a child would be expected to use self- regulatory private speech in those situations which require self regulation and executive functioning and not in other contexts where self direction is relatively unnecessary
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",4,"For example, during challenging problem solving activity with little external (parental or caregiver) regulation present, children would be more likely to use private speech as a tool to regulate their behavior than they would during non demanding leisure activity."

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,"That is, what kinds of classroom contexts appear to facilitate or constrain children's spontaneous use of private speech?"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,"An understanding of the circumstances in which young children spontaneously use private speech is crucial 1) for educators who wish to promote rlf regulatory competence in their classrooms 2) for practitioners who wish to intervene with impulsive hyperactive children by training them to use private speech to gain self control over their behavior, and 3) for basic researchers of private speech who wish to better understand the relation between language and thought."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,"Since the preschool kindergarten period is a critical one for the development of self- regulation and private speech is a major tool children use to develop their self regulatory capacity (Diaz et al., 1990), knowledge of the classroom conditions which promote young children's use of private speech is of particular relevance for early childhood educators."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,"Only through such knowledge can we, as educators, act in a way that is consistent with the goal of providing developmentally appropriate education during early childhood by tailoring our educational practices to capitalize on and fostef the competencies which are developing during this period brede kamp 1987)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,"Although few investig r ions have examined private speech in classroom settings, private speech researchers in overall support of Vygotsky's predictions have found the following contextual variables to affect children's spontaneous use of private speech: 1) the type of task or activity the child is engaged in, 2) the difficulty level of the task, 3) the presence of others, and 4) the characteristics of others present (for a review, see Berk, 1992)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,"Most of these findings, however, have been obtained in laboratory settings."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,"We will first, therefore, review the findings from the earlier studies and then use them to formulate hypotheses about how private speech would be expected to vary in the more ecologically valid setting of the clas yr oorn"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",5,Type of Activity Private speech does not occur randomly across all of the differecit activities children might find themselves engaged in.

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"5 speech when they are engaged in a semistructured problem solving or goal directed task activity, compared to a free play situation (Berk & Garvin, 1984; Dickie, 1973; RI L'; 1979)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"This finding is directly in line with Vygotsky's predictions because it is in precisely thos, situations where the child is trying to solve a problem or reach a specific goal that s/he will spontaneously use private speech as a tool to help guide, monitor, and regulate her/his own behavior."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,When engaged in unstructured free play activities children generally do not need to use private speech because the self regulatory demands placed on them in these situations are minimal.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"Task Difficulty Another fairly consistent finding in the research literature is that, within a particular goal- directed activity, private speech increases with task difficulty"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"That is, children use more self- regulatory speech as their problem solving activity becomes more challenging (see an as to poulos & Krehbiel, 1985; beau dich on 197S: Deutsch & Stein, 1972; Kohlberg, Yaeger, & Hjertholm, 1968; Vygotsky, 19341962"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"HeiLhtened usage of private speech during cognitively challenging activity is generally thought tof-,v children sustain their attention, reflect on their problem solving activity, remain motivated, and overcome obstacles throughout the task."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"Behrend, Rosengren, and Perlmutter (1989) recently extended these findings, however, by demonstrating that private speech only increases under conditions of intermediate difficulty - that is, when a task is challenging to a child, but still within her/his range of capabilities"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"These authors call our attention to Vygotsky's original formulation of private speech as the intermediate sten in the internalization of verbal thought: When a task is easy for a child, the necessary regulatory capacities have been internalized already, and little private speech should be expected."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"As tasks become more difficult, and more appropriate for the child's ability, self regulatory private speech should increase, but only to a certain point."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"When a task is too difficult, and children do not have adequate regulatory capacities available, either their behavior will be unregulated and unsuccessful or some other external source of regulation will be required and private speech will decrease."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",6,"(Behrend, Rosengren, & perlmutter 1989, p. 307)"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"6 Thus, children have been found to use proportionately more private speech when they are engaged in moderately challenging problem solving activities"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"The presence and characteristics of others It is understandable that early studies of the effects of others' presence on private speech were inconclusive (for a review, see Fuson, 1979), because it is only now becoming clear that it is not simply the presence or absence of others that is important for children's private speech production but how much the others are (or are not) externally regulating the child's behavior (Behrend, Rosengren, & perlmutter 199: ; Diaz, 1992)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"If there is no need for a child to regulate her/his own behavior (i.e., if other people are doing it for her/him), then private speech would not be expected to occur."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"In contrast, if an adult or more competent peer were helping a child complete a task on her/his own, then the child's private speech would be expected to increase."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"Thus, when children are in a context where their attempts at self direction are being supported, private speech should be maximized."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,One context which provides minimal external regulation of children's activity is when they are alone.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"Several researchers have found that young children's private speech increases when they work alone on a task, compared to working with an adult teacher or a parent (Berk & Garvin, 1984; Martlew, Connolly, & McCleod, 1978; Rubin, Hultsch, & Peters, 1971)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"Although these studies did not explicitly measure the adults' helping behaviors, it is presumed that the observed decrease in private speech when the child is with an adult is due to the adult being relatively directive, thereby externally regulating the child's activity."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,A second social situatioi which seems tJ e icourage the use of private speech and self- direction is when young children are in the presence of an adult who is carefully scaffolding the child's problem solving activity.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"Recently, a group of studies has provided preliminary support for the idea that children use a considerable amount of private speech when they are accompanied by an adult who is scaffolding their mutual goal directed activity."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",7,"In such contexts adults encourage the child to self direct as much as possible, contingently keeping the task demands at al appropriately challenging level and helping the child stay engaged with the task (Behrend et al., 7"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"7 Wins ler, Atencio, & Diaz, 1991)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"Similarly, Goudena (1987) demonstrated that a 1989, 1992; collaborative condition in which an adult allowed youngsters to complete an activity by themselves while remaining available and responsive to their requests for help, yielded significantly greater amounts of private speech from the children during a subsequent session while working alone than did having children work in what he called his non collaborative condition"" in which no contingent support took place."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"Thirdly, numerous investigators have demonstrated that private speech is augmented when young children are w;th their peers as opposed to with adults (Berk & Garvin, 1984; Dickie, 1973; Kohlberg et al., 1968; Vygotsky, 19341962"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"Since peers seem to function less as direct regulators of children's behavior than do adults (Azmitia & perlmutter 1989), the observed increase in self regulatory private speech when young children are with their peers can be interpreted as being, at least in part, due to the decreased amount of other regulation present in this context."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"Thus, a number of investigations have suggested that young children's use of private speech varies according to theoretically relevant contextual variables."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"However, with the notable exception of Berk and her colleagues (see Berk, 1986; Berk & Garvin, 1984; Berk & Potts, 1991), the vast majority of the studies were conducted in laboratory or quasi laboratory type settings."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"Mixed-age grouping There has been renewed interest over the past few years in the field of early childhood education in the idea of mixed-age grouping, that is, placing children of slightly different ages together in one classroom."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"In addition to having an intuitive appeal for many parents and teachers, mixed-age grouping in early childhood has been claimed to be beneficial for children's social and cognitive development (Katz, Evangelou, & Hartnitui, 1990)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",8,"Based on the foregoing review, there are a number of reasons to expect that the amount of private speech exhibited by children in a mixed-age classroom would differ from that exhibited in a same-age class."

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"It is unclear, therefore, from previous research and theory, in which type of classroom situation more private speech should occur."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"On the one hand, there are several reasons to expect children to use more private speech in mixed-age classrooms"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"Firs!, it has been suggested that youngsters in mixed-age groups do more tasks either on their own or with the help of other children, resulting in less direct adult intervention in the classroom (Katz et al., 1990)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"Indeed, children in mixed-age classes have been shown to spend more time in social interaction with their classmates and less time in direct interaction with tel chers than youngsters in same-age classes (Goldman, 1981; Reuter & Yunik, 1973)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,Recall here that researchers have found children to use more private speech when they are with their peers than when they are with adults.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"Second, there has been a recent suggestion that children in mixed-age classrooms engage in more goal directed task activity, and for longer periods of time, than do children in same-age classes (see Katz et al., 1990)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,Recall also that young children have been found to use more self regulatory speech during goal directed problem solving activity.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"In addition, older and more competent children in mixed-age situations do appear to assist, lead, and help younger children in a positive, prosocial way (French, Waas, Stright, & Baker, 1986; Stright & French, 1988)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"This assistance from other children has been likened to scaffolding (Katz et al., 1990), and it is possible that this type of mixed-age peer interaction helps both the younger and older children in the class engage in and maintain problem solving activity."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,This type of interaction also seems to have a direct and positive effect on the younger child's subsequent private speech.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,Azmitia (1992) recently observed that more competent peers function as facilitators of subsequent verbal self regulation in less competent children.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"Azmitia recorded the private speech of 40, five-year old novices who were individually working on a lego building task before arid after they worked either with an expert, with another novice, or alone."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",9,"She found that the novice five year olds who had worked with an expert peer used significantly more private speech at post- test compared to pre-test, whereas the private speech of the other two groups did not change."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"9 Finally, Lougee and Graziano (1986, reported by Kotz et al., 1990) proposed that mixed- age classes improve the self regulatory skills of older children because, by enforcing classroom rules and helping the younger children in the class, older children are better able to reflect upon and regulate their own behavior, Given the crucial role that private speech plays in the development of self regulation (Diaz et aL, 1990), it is quite possible that self regulatory language mediates, or is the mechanism for, the development of these self regulatory skills."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"On the other hand, there is also reason to suspect that children would use lelai private speech in mixed-age classrooms because of the presence of the older children in the class."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"Tudge (1990) has pointed out that children, rather than being good scaffold ers are often quite controlling in their interactions with younger peers."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"Congruent with this position, Azmitia and Perlmutter (1989) have noted that ""expert"" children often interact with ""novice"" peers in a dominating and controlling way."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"If this is the case, then the older children in the mixed-age class would suppress the younger children's private speech usage by being overly directive."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"liatarsitotau4 The present investigation fills an important gap in the private speech literature in that, although there are a number of previous studies suggesting that young children's spontaneous use of self regulatory private speech is influenced by theoretically relevant contextual variables, evidence of ecological validity is sorely lacking."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,Almost every investigation in this area has observed children in either a psychologists research laboratory or in an experimentally manipulated separate room within a preschool or child care facility.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"The typical protocol for these studies has involved an experimenter bringing the child or dyad into the research room, giving them instructions as to what they are to do with the experimenters materials, and then observing their behavior (with or without a video camera)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",10,"Since it is quite possible that young children's behavior in these rather contrived situations does not generalize to their typical behavior in school or at home, a naturalistic investigation of how youngsters use self regulatory language in their everyday environments was clearly needed."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",11,"10 The present study attempts to replicate, in a naturalistic school setting, the findings from earlier private speech studies by directly observing children's use of private speech as it spontaneously occurs in a variety of different classroom contexts which vary along the dimensions which have been previously noted to affect private speech production"

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",11,"The purpose of the present investigation was therefore twofold: 1) to replicate some of the previous laboratory findings in a more ecologically valid and natura f stic setting, and 2) lo examine the impact of several common early childhood classroom practices on private speech and to compare these practices on the degree to which they promote opportunities for self direction using quantity of private speech as a measure of self regulatory behavior."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",11,"The hypotheses for the present project were that children would use more private speech 1) during the classroom contexts which provide intermediate amounts of structure or external regulation compared to those which are either very structured or completely unstructured 2) when they are engaged in goal directed problem solving activity, compared to free play; and 3) when they are either with their peers or alone, compared to with adults."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",11,"No hypothesis was offered with regard to the mixed-age vs. same- age variable, since it was unclear what effect, if any, mixed-age grouping per se would have on children's use of private speech."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",11,"If the children in the mixed-aged class spend more time in goal- directed, academic activity and less time interacting directly with the teacher, then we would expect to see more private speech in the multi-age classroom."

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",18,"Thus, in this investigation the extent to which young children used private speech did not appear to be affected by whether they were alone, with other children, or in the presence of an adult."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",19,"18 However, an interesting and unexpected finding with regar : to the effect of social context on private speech was that children's use of private speech while with other children varied systematically depending on the age of the accompanying peers."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",19,"As shown :I Figure 4, kindergarteners in the mixed-age class used significantly more private speech with their younger peers (27.6%) than with either same-age (7.4%), or older (3.9%) companions X2 (3, Nobs = 226) = 8.94, 12 < .05."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",19,"A fairly linear relationship is suggested in these data between the age of an accompanying peer and amount of private speech used by kindergarteners that is, the older the companion, the less private speech is used, and if the accompanying peers are of a mixture of ages (younger, same-age and older), an intermediate amount of private speech (14.5%) is used."

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",19,Another interesting finding of the present study was the suggestion of a gender difference in the amount of spontaneous private speech used by young children.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",19,"There was a strong, albeit nonsignificant trend, / (17) = 1.94,12 = .07, for boys to use more private speech overall (16% of the time) than girls (8%)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",19,"Because girls spent more than twice as much of their time with adults than did boys (7% vs. 3%), and because less private speech is generally used by children when they are in the presence of adults, it was thought that this gender difference could be due to the girls' extTa time with the teachers."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",19,"However, even.after limiting the observations to those that occurred when the children were with other children working on a task, boys used nearly twice as much private speech (33%) compared to girls (17%),1 (18) = 1.89, g < .05."

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,"Discussion This investigation addressed the question of how young children's spontaneous use of private speech in the naturalistic setting of the kindergarten classroom varies according to contextual variables in the classroom, including age composition classroom context or amount of teacher given structure, social context, and type of activity."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,The results suggest that private speech does indeed occur systematically in certain situations and less so in others.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,"This study replicates a number of earlier findings in different settings, fails to replicate some others, and suggests a few areas in need of further research."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,Probably the most robust finding in this investigation is that private speech occurs mostly in situations when the child is engaged in a problem solving or goal directed type of activity compared to other types of activity.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,"This finding replicates that of previous researchers in the classroom (Berk & Garvin, 1984), confirms in a more ecologically valid setting the earlier laboratory findings (Dickie, 1973; Rubin, 1979), and gives strong support to the idea that young children do use private speech as a tool for guiding their behavior in challenging academic situations which require executive types of abilities."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,"It is essential for educators to note that private speech is an important tool used by children to guide and regulate their problem solving activities and that its use should not be discouraged by a teacher who wishes to maintain a ""quiet"" classroom."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,the Another finding of the study was that private speech varied systematically depending on in external regulation given by the classroom context (Figure 2).
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",20,Of the four classroom contexts

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,Ust private speech 666 was used.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,The data suggest that a curvilinear relationship exists between the amouc of external regulation provided by a context and the amount of self regulatory speech used by young children.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,"In other words, young children's use of pri .te speech is maximized in those situations which provide enough structure to facilitate their active engagement in cognitively challenging activity, and private speech is minimized in contexts which provide either a great deal of external behavioral regulation or very little external structure."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,"For example, during a highly structured teacher directed academic activity where the teacher is telling the children exactly what to do each step of the way, the children do not need to use self regulatory speech to guide their thinking or behavior because such guidance is being provided for them externally"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,"Likewise, during a highly unstructured activity, like free play outside during recess, children do not need to use private speech as a self- regulatory tool because, most likely, there are few cognitively challenging demands being placed on them in this setting."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,interestingly the teacher directed spontaneous context was also the one in which the children spent the highest proportion of their time (80%) engaged in goal oriented task-like activities
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,This finding may seem counterintuitive to educators who believe that children spend more time on task during the most teacher directed or structured activities
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,"nevertheless the results of this study suggest that if the goal is to maximize the amount of time young children spend working productively toward a goal, then the best strategy is to provide a framework of inst nic tional goals and task activities but then to let children be actively engaged in setting priorities planning their approach to the task, experimenting with possibilities monitoring feedback, and evaluating their own work."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,The fact that both private speech and goal directed task activity were most common during the TDS context could lead one to the conclusion that it was simply the goal directed activity which accounted for the private speech and not the classroom structure.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",21,"However, the results of the hierarchical regression procedures indicated that both (and only) activity and classroom context"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,21 contributed unique variance to the prediction of private speech.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,"Even after activity was entered into the model, classroom context continued to add significantly to the prediction"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,The results on the effect of mixed-age interaction on private speech from this study are interesting in that they depend on the level of analysis.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,"At the classroom level, no significant difference in the overall amount of private speech used by the children in the two types of classes was observed."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,"There was only an nonsignificant trend for more private speech to be used in the mixed-age class, which is probably indirectly explained by the strong but also nonsignificant trend for more goal directed work activity to occur in the mixed-age class."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,"At the individual level, however, looking within the peer interactions in the mixed-age class, significantly more private speech was observed when the kindergarteners were with their younger classmates and less private speech was observed as the age of an accompanying peer increased (Figure 4)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,"Thus, there seems to be supporting evidence from this investigation for both of the hypotheses noted earlier regarding the consequences for private speech of placing children in mixed-age classes."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,Because the target children in this study were kindergarteners - the children in the middle of the age facilitating effect of mixed-age grouping on private hierarchy in the mixed-age class - both the speech (when the children were with their younger counterparts as well as the suppressing effect of mixed-age grouping on private speech (when the kindergarteners were with their older classmates were observed.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,Why kindergarteners use more private speech while with their younger counterparts and what exactly it is they do at these times is not clear.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,"However, the fact that they do use more self- regulatory language under these circumstances is commensurate with the claim by advocates of mixed-age grouping (Katz et al., 1990; Lougee & Graziano, 1986) that older children's self- regulation appears to be benefited by being grouped with younger peers."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",22,A closer look at the observations involving children interacting with their younger peers revealed that about 70% of the private speech utterances occurred when they were mutually engaged in goal directed task activities

"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,TV observed suppression of self- regulatory speech when youngsters are with older classmates suggests that the older children are indced being quite active and directive with their younger counterparts
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,"Thus, it appears that mixed-age grouping alone, as a classroom setting, does not produce an effect on the overall amount of self regulatory language used in the classroom, for at the classroom level, the differences observed in private speech usage due to the age of accompanying classmates cancel each other out when they are averaged across both social situations (with older and with younger students)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,"Mixed-age grouping could influence private speech production through a different route, however, by affecting the type of activity that goes on in the classroom."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,"There is still the possibility that more goal oriented task activity goes on in mixed-age, compared to same-age classrooms"
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,That the present study found a marginally significant (p = .08) difference in the amount of goal directed activity in the two classrooms (greater in the mixed-age class) is interesting and suggests that more research should be conducted on this question.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,An obvious limitation of the present study with regard to increasing our understanding of the effect of peer age on private speech was that neither the private speech nor the actual behavior of the older and younger children during the observations was recorded.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,"Clearly, further research is needed in order to understand the content and function of the dynamic social interaction which takes place during these mixed-age situations and to explore the effect of mixed-age interaction on the self regulatory development of young children."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,"There were no significant differences in private speech usage depending on whether the child was alone, with other children, exclusively with an adult, or in an adult's presence."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,"The present study, therefore, fails to replicate many of the earlier findings on the effect of social context on private speech (Berk & Garvin, 1984; Dickie, 1973; Kohlberg et al., 1968; Martlew, et al., 1978; Rubin et al., 1971; Vygotsky, 19341962 but is consistent with more recent work (Behrend et al., 1992) in suggesting that what is important for children's spontaneous use of private speech is not so much whether other people are present or not, but what it is the people light on the present are actually doing."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",23,unfortunately the data from this study do not shed any
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,23 interpersonal dynamics present during these different types of social interaction
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"The failure to obtain an effect of social context on private speech is not surprising however, given the uaequal distribution of observations with respect to this variable."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"As can be seen in Figure 1, there were very few observations where the child was alone, and only limited opportunities to observe the children either exclusively with an adult, or in the presence of an adult."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"Lastly, the suggestion of a gender difference in the amount of private speech used by young children is interesting and not without precedent."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"Duncan (1991) also found that 4- and 5- year old boys were more likely to use private speech than were girls, and Berk and Garvin (1984) reported that, in their sample of 5-, 8-, and 10-year old elementary school children, the boys used significantly more of the egocentric or ""immature"" types of private speech than did girls."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,We interpret this gender difference in private speech usage to be due to at least two factors.
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"First, it is consistent with the well documented finding in the clinical literature that self regulatory difficulties or disorders (i.e., ADHD, impulsivity hyperactivity are more commonly observed in boys than in girls (Ross & Ross, 1982)."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"If private speech is a tool used by young children to gain self- regulatory control over behavior, and if boys have, for whatever reason, more difficulty with impulsivity and in attention then it makes sense for boys to engage in relatively more private speech because in order for them to maintain similar levels of functioning they would need to use this self regulatory tool more often."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"Also, it is commonly reported that boys and girls mature at different rates."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"Given that girls are often considered to be one or two years more biologically mature, in some ways, than boys, and given the well documented curvilinear relationship between age and private speech usage ira uen glass & Diaz, 1985; Kohlberg et al., 1968), it is logical that boys would use more private speech than girls because girls of the same age are farther along on the developmental trajectory of internalizing private speech."
"Private speech in the classroom the effects of activity type, presence of others, classroom context, and mixed age grouping.pdf",24,"In summary, young children use a substantial amount of private speech in tFt classroom."

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,Due to the importance of teacher child interaction quality on children’s learning and development this study aimed to understand how children’s behavior at an aggregate level was related to teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"As part of this work, we also examined the role of mixed-age classrooms (i.e., those serving children of different ages in the same classroom which make up roughly 75% of all Head Start classrooms (Ansari & Purtell, 2018)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,Little research has explored how mixed-age classrooms may be related to teacher- child interaction quality and the relationship between classroom level problem behaviors and teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"Given the developmental trajectory of children’s regulatory capacities during the preschool period and the different expectations for classroom behavior for children of varying ages, these processes may unfold differently in classrooms serving younger (e.g., 3- and 4- year-olds) and older (e.g., 4 year olds children."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,"This study aimed to elucidate how problem behaviors, averaged across children in a classroom, contributed to teacher child interaction quality in mixed-age Head Start classrooms and classrooms serving 4 year olds only."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,Results from this study can assists Head Start and other preschool programs better understand how children’s behaviors may be related to teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,2,practically these findings provide ideas for potential professional development and ongoing support for teachers that can help them manage problem behavior and improve the overall teacher child interaction quality.

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,teacher child interaction quality may vary depending on the type of classroom level problem behavior displayed.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"As posited by the burnout cascade theory, teachers tend to feel more negative and stressed when they perceive aggression opposition behavior in the classroom, leading to anger and frustration because these behaviors hamper their teaching ability (Bosman et al., 2019)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Moreover, following the contagion theory, children also exhibit more aggression opposition when in classrooms with higher levels of aggression opposition (Thomas et al., 2011)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"classroom level aggression opposition often inhibits teachers’ ability to provide consistent emotional support and positive behavior management (Zinsser et al., 2013) and reduces the available instructional time (Long et al., 2018)."

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,Like the extant literature on classroom level aggression opposition there are mixed findings regarding the relationship between classroom level hyperactivity and teacher child interaction quality.

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"(2019), teachers reported using more sensitive practices when responding to individual children’s hyperactive behaviors in the classroom."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Teachers’ increased sensitivity for hyperactive behaviors among children may be due to greater awareness about hyperactivity and symptoms of ADHD and when teachers understand what children are not able to or otherwise struggle to control their behavior in the classroom, this may influence the sensitivity of their teaching in a positive way (Chang & Davis, 2009)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Given these mixed results, we hypothesized that higher rates of classroom level hyperactivity would be negatively related to emotional support and classroom organization"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,Less attention has been paid to the association between children’s internalizing behaviors and teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Compared to children with more disruptive problem behaviors like externalizing and hyperactivity behaviors, children with inter- nalizing symptoms often receive less attention from teachers because their problems are less apparent and more difficult to detect berg nielsen et al., 2012)."

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,Mixed-age classrooms as a potential moderator Children’s behavior and teacher child interaction quality may unfold and interact differently in classrooms serving older children versus classrooms serving children across a broader age range.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"For example, although some Head Start programs serve 3- and 4-year- olds in separate classrooms most Head Start programs combine 3- and 4 year olds in mixed-age classrooms (Ansari & Pianta, 2019)."

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"(2014) investigated interrelations among age composition teacher child interaction quality, and children’s skills and found that mixed-age classrooms were beneficial for preschoolers but only when coupled with high- quality interactions"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"In addition, prior studies have not examined, to our knowledge, the extent to which the age grouping of class- rooms (same-age or mixed-age) interacts with classroom level problem behaviors to contribute to teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,We predicted that mixed-age classrooms would moderate the relationship between classroom level problem behaviors and teacher- child interaction quality based on the theoretical and limited empirical literature
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"However, the direction of the hypothesis remained exploratory given the limited prior research and theory."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,It is plausible that the negative association between classroom level problem behaviors and teacher child interaction quality may be even more pronounced in mixed-age classrooms than in classrooms serving 4- year-olds where the association may be less pronounced or nonexistent
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Prior studies suggest that managing a classroom with a wide range of ages and diverse needs can be challenging (Guo et al., 2014) and uniquely stressful to teachers friedman krauss et al., 2014)."

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Therefore, it is plausible that mixed-age grouping is negatively related to teacher child interaction quality (Ansari & Pianta, 2019), that classroom- level problem behaviors are negatively related to teacher child interaction quality (Partee et al., 2020), and that these challenges are magnified when in combination resulting in lower teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"In contrast, we might find that the associations between classroom level problem behaviors and teacher child interaction quality were less pronounced in mixed-age classrooms than in classrooms serving 4 year olds only."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,3,"Drawing upon developmental theories, we hypothesized that what was developmentally normative – and teachers’ expectations about what was developmentally normative – for a 3-year-old may be different from what was normative for a 4-year-old (Chang & Davis, 2009)."

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,It is plausible that teachers may perceive behavioral challenges and react to them differently in mixed-age classrooms versus classrooms serving only 4 year olds
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,"For instance, in mixed-age classrooms 3-year-old children may exhibit more internalizing behaviors such as crying when parents leave the classroom, but because the teacher may perceive that behavior as more developmentally appropriate they may warmly comfort those children, which is associated with higher quality classrooms"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,conversely more classroom level problem behaviors in 4-year-old only classrooms may be related to lower teacher child interaction quality because teachers see oppositional aggressive hyperactivity and internalizing behaviors as inap- propriate for 4 year olds
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,"In other words, expectations about children in mixed-age classrooms may have buffered preschool teachers against the difficulties of handling more behavioral challenging classrooms"

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,4,Given the mixed findings in the literature we heavily relied upon our theoretical frameworks and prior studies to propose the following exploratory hypotheses (a) higher levels of classroom oppositional aggressive behavior would be negatively related to emotional support and classroom organization (b) higher levels of classroom hyperactivity would be negatively related to emotional support and classroom organization and (c) higher levels of classroom internalizing behaviors would be negatively related to emotional support.

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,7,"To help assure the robustness of our findings and avoid potential Type I (false positive) errors, we applied the benjamin i hochberg procedure to all estimated coefficients"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,7,"The benjamin i hochberg procedure controls the false discovery rate (FDR) using sequential modified Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,7,"This procedure was implemented by first ordering all p-values from smallest to largest and assigning ranks to each value (e.g., the smallest p-value had a rank of 1)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,7,"We then calculated each individual p-value’s benjamin i hochberg critical value, using the formula (i/m)Q where i is the p-value rank, m is the total number of tests, and Q is the false discovery rate of 10%."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,7,"Finally, we only interpreted coefficients as statistically significant if the benjamin i hochberg critical value was <0.05."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,7,The p-values presented in the findings and tables thus reflect the findings from models employing these procedures
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,7,"The following cut-off values were used for the evaluation of the effect sizes (Funder & Ozer, 2019): tiny ≤ 0.05, very small from 0.05 to ≤0.10, small from 0.10 to ≤0.20, medium from 0.20 to ≤0.30, large from 0.30 to ≤0.40, and very large >0.40."

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,conversely the present study explored whether classroom level problem behaviors were associated with teacher child inter- action quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,This study’s primary objective was to examine the role of fall classroom level problem behavior on spring teacher child interaction quality and to explore whether classroom age composition moderated the relationship between classroom level problem behavior and teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,Our results found that classroom level oppositional aggressive and internalizing behavior were associated with lower teacher child interaction quality even after controlling for teacher child interaction quality in the year prior.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"That is, classrooms with higher mean oppositional aggressive and internalizing behaviors were rated as having lower levels of emotional support, classroom organization and instructional support, although the effect sizes suggested only small associations"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"Although we did not specify any hypotheses for the association between classroom level problem behaviors and instructional support, our results suggest a negative, significant relationship"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"Given the considerably low rates of instructional support in classrooms found in prior studies (e.g., Curby et al., 2009; Hamre et al., 2013; Mashburn et al., 2008; von such o do letz et al., 2014), these results suggest that classroom level problem behavior may be a contributor"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"This trend of lower instructional support quality is critical because instructional support is the core of teaching practices linked to students’ academic learning and engagement (Hamre et al., 2013)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"There also were null interaction results, which suggest that classroom level oppositional aggressive and internalizing behaviors and the age composition of children in classrooms do not interact in a way that related to teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,potentially teachers have difficulty dealing with oppositional aggressive and internalizing behaviors or find them more troubling when displayed by children regardless of classroom age composition
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"Finally, it is possible that the null findings for interactions with classroom level internalizing behavior could be due to methodological issues (e.g., teacher reports of internalizing behavior may be less reliable and difficult for teachers to report; McElwain & Volling, 2005)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"importantly we also examined hyperactivity as a separate dimension of problem behavior rather than as a dimension of exter- nalizing behavior as it is frequently operationalized in other studies (e.g., Montroy et al., 2014; Williford & Wolcott, 2015)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"We found that when classroom level hyperactivity was higher, teacher child interaction quality was lower in 4-year-old only classrooms"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"In contrast, within mixed-age classrooms teacher child interaction quality scores remained stable as classroom level hyperactivity increased."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"Although these effects were small in magnitude, they provisionally suggest that teachers within 4-year-old only classrooms may struggle to maintain teacher child interaction quality when higher rates of classroom level hyperactivity are present."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"At the very least, the current findings suggest preliminary patterns that warrant further exploration"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,Several possible explanations exist for why lower levels of teacher child interaction quality may occur when classroom level hy- per activity is higher within 4-year-old classrooms
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"First, it could be due to teachers having specific expectations for how 4-year-old children should behave that differ from their expectations for 3-year-old children’s behavior (e.g., Brophy & Good, 1970)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,Teach- ers’ expectations about children’s hyperactivity could be related to their beliefs about normative development
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"Prior studies illustrate that children with hyperactive behaviors tend to have difficulty focusing their attention long enough or well enough to learn (Barkley, 2015)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,Teachers may expect children in mixed-age classrooms particularly the 3 year olds to exhibit more hyperactive behavior.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"It is also plausible that the emphasis on kindergarten readiness has led to increased pressure and apprehension among preschool teachers particularly those in 4-year-old only classrooms Brown et al., 2019); this heightened focus on academic content and teachers’ ex- pectations for how children should behave could be related to higher expectations for behaviors among teachers within 4-year-old only classrooms (Le et al., 2019)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,These expectations of children’s behaviors may be associated with teachers being less tolerant of hyperactivity with children within 4-year-old only classrooms
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"High rates of classroom level hyperactivity such as children impulsively getting up from circle time or interrupting a book reading with lots of talking, may be particularly frustrating for teachers."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,Hamre et al.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,(2008) found that older children were reported to have more conflict with teachers than expected based on their level of teacher reported problem behavior.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,This suggests that teachers may be less permissive of hyperactivity among children in 4-year-old only classrooms even if they are displaying similar rates of hyperactivity as 3-year-old children.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"Teachers may also feel that 4-year-old children could have controlled their problem behaviors had they wanted to or had specific intentions with their behavior, which could amplify teachers’ negative reactions."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"As a result, teachers may feel frustrated or angry, which in turn may negatively influence the sensitivity of their practices."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"In this study we controlled for teacher child interaction quality in the prior year; thus, only the variance in the spring teacher child interaction quality not explained by teacher child interaction quality scores in the previous year could be related to classroom level problem behaviors."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,This suggests that classrooms teacher child interaction quality scores may be partially dependent on classroom level problem behaviors and teachers’ reactions to those problem behaviors.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"In other words, the composition of children in the classroom, and in this case, the mean levels of problem behaviors, play a unique role in the teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,"Although teacher child interaction quality (i.e., CLASS scores) tends to be relatively stable throughout the year, teacher child inter- action quality potentially may fluctuate year to year (and even within the year; Burchinal, 2018)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,13,It may be that levels of teacher child interaction quality shift year to year as the composition of children’s problem behaviors fluctuate and teachers vary in their ability to adjust their teaching to address the behaviors (Patrick & mantz ico poulos 2016).

Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"limitations and future directions Although much of the extant literature relies on teacher reports of children’s problem behavior, we consider this to be a potential limitation of this study."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Despite teachers being able to provide valuable perspectives relating to child problem behavior because they observe behaviors outside of the home setting, witness children in situations that provoke strong reactions, and develop norms regarding child development due to their exposure to multiple children (Saudino et al., 2005), teachers’ judgments of children are partly associated with teachers’ existing perspectives that may be shaped by personal or psychological characteristics (Mashburn et al., 2006)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,observations of teacher child interaction quality may relate to other variables associated with the teacher’s relationship with children that are correlated with their perceptions and ratings of children; we cannot disentangle these potential associations
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,Future research should explore how different developmental expectations of teachers in mixed-age vs. 4-year-old classrooms and increased pressure on teachers for kindergarten readiness may relate to teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Similarly, future research should examine whether teachers’ beliefs about developmentally normative child behavior may indeed be influenced by classroom age composition to do so, surveys of teachers’ beliefs of children’s behaviors may need to be developed given the lack of existing measures."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,A second concern is that classroom level problem behaviors may have been underestimated because our assessment was based only on those children who consented to participate in the study rather than all children in each classroom.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Prior studies suggest that parents of most at-risk children are less likely to provide consent for their child to participate in research (Heinrichs et al., 2005)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Although the study randomly sampled, on average, 10 children per classroom, and given the consent rate across centers was approximately 90%, we believe that we have a fair representation of eligible children within each classroom (Morris et al., 2014)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,Because the data consisted of a sample of children from low-income backgrounds there may be more children with problem behaviors than one might find in a non head start preschool classroom.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Thus, the results from this study may only be generalizable for a Head Start sample."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,This study should be replicated in a sample with children from higher income backgrounds or classrooms that serve mixed income populations
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Similarly, future studies could examine whether different methods of using individual level data to represent classroom composition is related to teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,An additional limitation concerns our measure of age composition
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,We used a binary variable indicating whether the classroom was a mixed-age classroom or a 4-year-old only classroom.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,Future work should be done to understand whether the proportion of 3-year- olds or the range of children’s ages is related to teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"In this study, we used mean teacher ratings of children’s problem behavior levels to represent the classroom composition of problem behavior."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"nonetheless other studies should examine whether different classroom behavioral composition factors (e.g., standard deviations around mean, using the proportion of children in each classroom that scored above the whole sample 75th percentile besides the classroom mean influence teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Due to our use of a secondary data set, we were restricted to the measurement timing as determined by the original researchers (Morris et al., 2014)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"One limitation is that the baseline teacher child interaction quality observation used as a covariate in our analysis, was collected in the prior year."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,This means we controlled teacher child interaction quality in classrooms with a different cohort of children.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"additionally due to teacher turnover between school years (about 25%), the teachers observed for the teacher child interaction quality measure are sometimes different at baseline compared to post assessment"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,Another limitation due to the timing of the baseline teacher child interaction quality observation is that we could not test the bidirectional model.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,nonetheless future research should intentionally design data collection to examine potential bidirectional associations between problem behavior and teacher child interaction quality within and across school years and to control for baseline teacher child interaction quality collected within the same school year.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Finally, given work that has found day-to-day variations in teacher child interaction quality (e.g., Patrick & mantz ico poulos 2016), future studies should consider conducting more than one classroom observation to get a more accurate assessment of quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,Future work should examine possible mechanisms to explain the relationship between classroom level problem behaviors and teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"For instance, questions remain about whether this relationship is mediated by teacher stress or lack of time on instructional content."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,understanding the mechanism of this will provide valuable information for potential interventions
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,12.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,implications for practice and policy The results of this study have potential implications for educational practice and policy.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,From a practice perspective a critical concern is how to support teachers in providing high quality interactions when faced with high-level classroom problem behaviors.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Given results suggesting that classroom level problem behaviors are negatively related to teacher child interaction quality, the study’s findings suggest the need to provide universal interventions such as Preschool Paths, Tools of the Mind, I Can Problem Solve, and The Incredible Years, that do not just target children who face various disadvantages but programs that can be delivered to the whole classroom (Bierman & Motamedi, 2015; Murano et al., 2020)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Although many universal interventions focus on supporting teachers to improve the emotional and relational aspects of the classroom, impacts have also been found on the instructional support of the classroom (e.g., Morris et al., 2014)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Given the low rates of instructional support in preschool classrooms across the country and the globe, universal interventions that focus on classroom problem behaviors could be a mechanism to improve these scores (e.g., Curby et al., 2009; Hamre et al., 2013; Mashburn et al., 2008; Von such o do letz et al., 2014)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"For example, My Teaching Partner, an intervention where teachers work one-on-one with a coach using videotaped observations has resulted in higher scores on instructional support (Early et al., 2017)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"Finally, a school psychologist or behavior consultant may be needed to help teachers understand how to best support different needs within a classroom."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,"For example, the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP), which uses a mental health consultant who coaches teachers, offers a promising approach for reducing children’s problem behaviors in classroom settings (Raver et al., 2008)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,14,14
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"Given that classroom level problem behaviors influence teacher child interaction quality, it may be advantageous to develop policies that encourage the mixing of children with varying hyperactivity levels in a classroom."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,Methods of assigning children to teachers that consider a teacher’s threshold for handling hyperactivity behaviors can also be considered to promote a high quality preschool classroom.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"Given that many preschool teachers lack the knowledge and skills to work with children who have chronic problem behavior, particularly hyperactivity (Hemmeter et al., 2006), providing support to increase teachers’ awareness, knowledge, and effectiveness with problem behaviors could help increase high quality teacher child interactional quality within 4-year-old only classrooms"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"Similarly, creating mixed-age classrooms could be related to higher teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"nonetheless it could be useful for teachers to increase their awareness of how behavioral problems, like hyperactivity and characteristics of children contribute to their feelings and perceptions and evaluate how these problems influence their daily practices."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"It is possible that teachers need additional training in dealing with problem behaviors and the positive or negative emotions that follow certain behaviors, particularly hyperactivity"
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"From a policy perspective it is important to understand how classroom level problem behaviors are related to instruments like the CLASS, that are routinely used for accountability and evaluation systems across the United States and the world (Vitiello et al., 2018)."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,The results of this study emphasize the need to consider the proportion of children in a classroom who demonstrate problem behaviors when interpreting teachers’ CLASS scores and making decisions based on these scores.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,13.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,Conclusion This study provides much needed insight into the implications of classroom level problem behavior on teacher child interaction quality.
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"In sum, classroom level problem behavior, specifically oppositional aggressive and internalizing behavior, was related to lower teacher child interaction quality."
Problem behaviors at the classroom-level and teacher-child.pdf,15,"furthermore classroom age composition moderated the relationship between classroom level hyperactivity and teacher child interaction quality; that is, teacher child interaction quality in 4-year-old classrooms decreased as mean levels of hyperactivity increased."

Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,DISCUSSION The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether grouping children heterogeneously or homogeneously with respect to age significantly influences the amount and nature of their social behavior.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"No main effects for same-age versus mixed-age groups were found in categories of social play, with remark- able similarity between the two groups in terms of play type."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,Children in both same-age and mixed-age groups spent about the same amount of time in social behavior.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,Subsequent analyses of the individual categories of social behavior revealed a similar pattern.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"With regard to style of play, most of the behaviors were coded as neutral for both same-age (91%) and mixed-age (92%) groups."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,These data suggest that the two group types do not result in dramatic differences in social behavior across children.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"Two exceptions to this statement are war- ranted, however."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"First, it appears that the rate of negative styles of play may be influenced by age composition of groups, with younger children exhibiting more negative styles of play in same-age groups and older children in mixed-age groups."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"It should be noted, however, that the overall level of negative behavior was low in both settings."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"Second, an analysis of the choice of play partners suggests that older children in mixed-age groups are likely to spend most (three quarters) of their time interacting with other older children."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,This study generally failed to support many of the findings reported by other investigators
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"In almost every study reviewed, significant differences between groups have been documented in some aspect of social play."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,"In general, these findings suggest that mixed-age groups may enhance the social behavior of younger children but not necessarily of older children."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,13,What factors contribute to this discrepancy in findings?

Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,This study is unique in that we randomly assigned children to play groups and allowed children a 6-month period to establish friendships and patterns of play.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,All of the children had initially been enrolled in the day-care center between 6 weeks and 3 months of age.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"During this time the children were exposed to a standard curriculum and all were enrolled in the same child-care facility, where all of the teachers were encouraged to adopt a common philosophy of caregiving that involved activity based learning."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,These procedures increased the likelihood that the two groups were similar with respect to the amount and nature of center based child-care experiences
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,Perhaps the fact that each of the published laboratory studies used unacquainted dyads of children influenced the rate at which certain behaviors occurred.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,Our findings suggest the possibility that familiarity and common experiences shared by the children par- ticipating in research studies may result in a pattern of behavior that differs from what would be observed with children who have no prior experiences with each other.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"When play behaviors were observed, we used a standardized play environ- ment so that group differences in play would not be inadvertently affected by type of toys available."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"The role of the adult in the play environment was limited and standardized across the classes, and we collected data only when all 6 children were present in each class, to ensure equality in partner choices during each session."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"Previous research involving groups of acquainted children has not con- trolled for group size, group assignment activity type, toy availability or adult role, variables known to influence social behavior."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,Our data suggest that when such variables are controlled patterns of social play may be similar in the two age groupings.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,Four limitations of the present study point to the need for replication and extension of this research.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"First, the sample size was small, especially consider- ing the number of independent and dependent variables."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"Although some signifi- cant results were obtained despite the small sample size, a replication would be important to verify these findings."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"In addition, our study looked at play groups consisting of 6 children."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,replications are needed in which size of the group is systematically varied.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"It may be that a larger group size, such as that more typically found in day-care centers, would result in a different pattern of play."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"Second, the analyses were limited to a broad based system for coding social behavior."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,Further studies should examine sequences of interactions or the cogni- tive levels of play to determine if the complexity of play varied by group type.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"Third, although the use of an analogue play environment helped to control key variables that might influence social behavior, the extent to which these findings would generalize to other play environments is uncertain."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,14,"replication studies should use other typical child-care activities (e.g., sand and water play, outdoor play, circle time, woodworking to determine if cross-age interactions and levels of social play vary by activity type."

Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,15,What are the implications of the present study for child-care providers who must make decisions about how to organize child-care settings?
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,15,Our data suggest that the two arrangements do not affect the overall level of social interactions and thus teachers should make this decision on the basis of other factors.
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,15,"How- ever, the limitations of this study and the discrepancies with prior studies suggest that any final suggestions may be premature."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,15,"In addition, a recent longitudinal study (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliam, 1993) indicates that mixed-age settings may benefit younger but not older children in terms of developmental progress, with the exception of social development which appeared to be superior for both older and younger children in mixed-age groups."
Social interactions of toddlers and preschoolers in same-age and mixed-age play groups.pdf,15,"bronfenbrenner (1976, 1977) suggested that much research has limited gener- a liz ability because it is not conducted in the ecology in which children and adults live and function."

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,11,Discussion This study examined the associations between situational peer-group age composition and caregiver behaviour in terms of what caregivers provide through their interactions with children.
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,11,As hypothesized wide age range was related to lower quality of observed emotional and behavioural support and engaged support for learning however when considering the number of very young children present the results yielded the following picture the number of infants present was found to be associated with the quality of caregiver child interactions
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,11,"As expected, the higher the actual number of children younger than 18 months present during the observation cycle the lower the level of emotional and behavioural support and engaged support for learning provided by caregivers"
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,11,"At the same time, the impact of age range was only marginally significant for emotional and behavioural sup- port, and no more significant for engaged support for learning."
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,11,These findings indicate that the negative association between age range and caregiver child interaction quality can be explained by the actual number of very young children present.
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,11,This effect was particularly evident in the quality of engaged support for learning.
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,11,"Numerous international studies have reported a generally moderate level of emotional and behavioural support, and a rather low level of engaged support for learning"

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,12,"Our study provided further evidence for these findings and indicated that children usually experience positive caregiving sensitivity and supportin regulating their emotions and behaviours with regard to engaged support for learning however, there is still significant potential for improvement caregivers are unlikely to provide high quality learning support, such as language model- ling or feedback the present study also indicated that caregiving becomes more complicated to plan and implement when several age groups are present at the same time, and particularly so in settings with a greater number of very young children."
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,12,The huge developmental differences between infants toddlers and preschoolers require activities to be adjusted to different childrens needs this challenging situation seems to limit care- givers’ opportunities for providing age- and developmentally appropriate curricula and encouraging childrens learning we assume furthermore that infants special needs such as emotional support feeding cradling them to sleep or changing nappies often interrupt activities with older children
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,12,The hypothesis that the median age of the peer group positively predicts caregivers behaviour was not supported by our results.
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,12,"This finding suggests that in the current situation the age range and especially the number of infants present seem to be more relevant than the situa- tional mean age – in contrast to previous studies, which investigated general mean age without considering other aspects of age composition de schipper et al 2006kugerkluczniok2009"
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,12,"strengths and limitations Our study has some limitations that should be taken into account, and that indicate directions for future research."
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,12,"The small sample size, in particular the small number of clusters 9 childcare groups led to statis tical limitations and an inability to consider confounding variables such as group size and caregiver child ratio, which have often been found to be associated with caregiving quality helmer horstetal2015reyhingetal 2019 however by analysing the cycle scores 144 observation cycles we increased statistical power."
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,12,The study design does not allow us to con- clude from the results whether mixed age grouping or grouping by age is preferable for this studies with an appropriate sample size and compar ing mixed-age and same-age childcare programmes are needed.

The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,14,"Further, we investigated age composition more closely and were able to show that the number of infants present seems to be more important for the quality of caregiving than does the breadth of peer- group age range in mixed age groupings thus the results demonstrated that the features of peer-group age composition in childcare should be viewed in a more differentiated way than only considering the breadth of age difference"
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,14,implications for policy and practice our findings are interesting not only for further research but also in terms of potential starting points for improving the quality of interactions between caregivers and children in mixed-age settings.
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,14,"Multi-age pro- grammes in early education and care should be carefully monitored, as the consequences of mixed-age grouping are not solely beneficial it can also have a negative effect on interaction quality between caregivers and children."
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,14,"In line with the previous guidelines provided by Swiss Childcare association ki be suisse formerly named KiTaS, 2008), children under 18 months of age require more intensive care and monitoring than older children and are weighted with a factor 1.5 (i.e., one child younger than 24monthsofageoccupies15 childcare place ski be suisse recommended limiting the number of infants in a mixed-age group to 2 and the total group size to a maximum of 10to12 children as already mentioned in the revised guidelines of Kibesuisse (2016) the regulation of caregiver child ratio is dependent on the age of children present that might contribute to the quality of caregiving"
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,14,unfortunately children’s age is no longer taken into account when calculating the maximum group size our results how ever suggest that the number of very young children present is relevant to the learning support provided by caregivers
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,14,We conclude therefore that there is a need for clear guidelines on the maximum number of infants and total group size depending on childcare group age characteristics
The impact of childcare group situational age composition on caregiver child interactions.pdf,14,"based on our results we want to highlight the importance of temporary but regular grouping by age within a general mixed-age structure, in order to provide age and developmentally appropriate curricula in their work with a broader variety of age groups, caregivers should address"

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,introduction understanding similarities and differences between mixed-age (MA) and same-age (SA) peer interactions among young children is a worthwhile endeavor for both theoretical and practical reasons.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"In terms of theory, both Vygotsky’s and Piaget’s works suggest differential effects on children’s cognitive and social development for asymmetric (MA) as opposed to symmetric (SA) peer interactions (Bailey, Burchinal, & McWilliam, 1993; Hartup, 1983; Piaget, 1932; Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 1998; Vygotsky, 19301978"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"interaction with SA peers who are more likely to be equal in terms of knowledge skill and power is thought to provide a unique context for children to engage in and resolve cognitive conflicts with others thereby stimulating cognitive, social, and moral development (Azmitia, 1988; Piaget, 1932, Tudge, 1992)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"interaction with older, more competent children is seen as an optimal context for facilitating cognitive and behavioral development according to Vygotskian and social learning cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986; Hartup, 1983; Vygotsky 193019351978"

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"It is important to note in this connection however, that most of the research exploring the effects of age composition on children’s peer interactions has been conducted in laboratory or quasi laboratory settings (e.g., placing children of various ages or ability levels together in the same room with a task and observing what happens)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,Less understood are the dynamics of SA and MA peer interactions that occur in naturalistic settings such as the early childhood classroom.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"In terms of practice, MA grouping has been enjoying renewed popularity within early childhood education (Katz et al., 1990; Lloyd, 1999)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"Advocates of MA grouping in early education claim that theMA classroom holds many social and cognitive advantages over SA classrooms by creating a richer and more diverse educational environment minimizing normative pressures and competition encouraging prosocial behavior, self regulation and social responsibility increasing children’s tolerance for diversity, and decreasing gender segregation der scheid 1997; Elkind, 1989; Goldman, 1981; Katz et al., 1990; Pratt, 1986; Roberts, Burchinal, & Bailey, 1994; the il heimer 1993; Whaley & Kantor, 1992)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,2,"In MA groupings, because a wider range of child competencies is expected in the first place, the teacher is seen as better able to notice and respond to individual differences in children and provide for a more diverse and individually tailored set of experiences than is the case within"

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Although several studies have found that younger children in MA groups, relative to sa groups play in more complex ways are more mature behaviorally and rely on their peers more and their teacher less (Goldman, 1981; Howes & Farver, 1987; Mounts & roop narine 1987 there are also numerous findings that are mixed roopnarineetal1992 while some have found increased prosocial behavior and less solitary play activities for all children in MA groupings (McClellan & Kinsey, 1999), others have found the reverse to be true roopnarineetal1992 others have suggested that the advantages of ma grouping may be present only for the younger children in the classroom (Bailey et al., 1993; Bailey, McWilliam, Ware, & Burchinal, 1993; Byrnes, Shuster, & Jones, 1994; Dunn, Kontos, & Potter, 1996; Roopnarine et al., 1992; Urberg & Kaplan, 1986)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Reviews of MA classrooms for older children in elementary school and beyond show that: (a) there are either no differences or a slight advantage for MA grouping, especially in terms of motivation self- concept, attitudinal and social adjustment variables and (b) that the advantages are often greater for the younger children than for the older classmates (Gutierrez & Slavin, 1992; Pavan, 1992; Veenman, 1995)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,A number of methodological problems and theoretical challenges account for the mixed findings and suggest fruitful avenues for continued research in this area.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"First of all, much of the research on early MA vs. SA classrooms suffers from the lack of an appropriate comparison group ma classrooms are often compared to sa classrooms at different centers with different teachers, different resources, different early childhood philosophies and different populations of families children"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Also, self selection biases are likely to be present at multiple levels, as parents who choose to send their children to, and centers that choose to offer, MA classrooms may be distinct in philosophical pedagogical orientation"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Finally, there is evidence that directors and principals often assign their better more experienced teachers to MA classes (Lloyd, 1999; Mason & Burns, 1996 thereby further complicating comparisons across the two types of classrooms"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"The present natural experiment avoids many of these methodological problems by studying one center’s transition from a SA to an MA classroom organization thereby largely holding teachers, curriculum early childhood philosophy and child population constant."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"Secondly, peer interactions and classroom dynamics are known to change over time over the course of the school year."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"For example, differences in the dynamics of peer interactions between MA and SA groupings have been found to decrease over time as peer familiarity in the classroom increases (Brody, Graziano, & Musser, 1983)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"However, systematic longi- tudinal study of change over time in MA classrooms is quite rare and when it has occurred, suboptimal time sampling strategies have been used."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,"For example, Roopnarine et al."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,(1992) observed indoor free play activities in two sa classrooms of 3yearoldstwosa classrooms of 4 year olds and two MA classrooms of 3- and 4 year olds for 1 week in a Fall semester and 1 week in the Spring semester.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,3,These investigators found little evidence of change over time in the outcomes explored however this could be due to sampling only a small window (1 week) at only two time points over the school year.

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"Third, it seems clear that the benefits and/or costs of MA interaction in early childhood programs are likely to depend on what is going on in the classroom, the broader classroom context, and how teachers choose to organize their classroom activities (Lloyd, 1999; Veenman, 1996; Winsler, 1993), rather than appearing as a simple main effect across the board for classroom age composition (MAvs."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,SA).
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"Winsler (1993), for example, found that the prosocial and cognitive benefits of MA peer interaction in kindergarten classrooms were strongest during classroom activity contexts that were moderately structured by the teacher, as opposed to either completely unstructured (outside free play) or very structured (large group teacher directed or teacher selected small group) activities"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"Observed in the present investigation therefore, was children’s behavior during three different classroom contexts that ranged from teacher directed to child self selected (within parameters to free-play activities"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,It seems clear that simple main effects for age grouping (MAvs.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"SA) that average across many other relevant variables are not expected, and that variables such as classroom context, age of child, and time during the school year are likely to moderate comparisons between MA and SA grouping."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"The present study, thus, attempts to explore some of these moderating relations systematically while holding constant some of the confounding variables in comparison groups that have gone uncontrolled in much of the previous research in the area."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"The following outcome variables were explored in this investigation children’s focused goal directed (on-task) behavior, sustained attention to activities social affiliation (whether the child was alone, with a peer, with a teacher), inappropriate behavior, expressed affect (positive, negative, neutral), and peer preference (whether, when given the choice, children’s playmates in the MA classrooms were of the same gender or age as themselves"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"These variables represent a combination of those explored by other inves- tigators as well as some new constructs to this literature (i.e., affect, sustained attention"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,Children’s social affiliation and peer preferences were examined to answer central and obvious questions of interest regarding whether manipulation of the social structure of the preschool classroom influences the topography of children’s social interactions and playmate preferences
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"Children’s engagement in sustained and goal directed activity was selected for study because children’s task engagement is not only a predictor of early school competence (Cooper & Farran, 1988) but also an indicator of preschool program quality (Ridley, McWilliam, & Oates, 2000) and thus of interest to the preschool staff."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"Finally, children’s expressed affect and inappropriate behavior were examined as these dimensions contribute to the overall social climate of early childhood classrooms (Howes, 2000; Stipek et al., 1998)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,Roopnarine et al.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,4,"(1992) found that gender segregation occurred more often in SA than in MA groups, which is consistent with earlier work showing that young children in MA company show less same gender preferences than children in homogenous age groups field 1982)."

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,the only main effect for classroom age composition observed in the present study was the interesting observation that children of both ages demonstrated significantly more overt positive affects miles laughter and less neutral affect in the sa classes compared to them a classes.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,It is worthwhile to point out in this connection that the lack of overt expressed positive affect does not mean that children were unhappy their overt affective expression could just have been and usually was in fact overtly neutral there were no classroom type differences observed for children’s overtly negative affect nor for their inappropriate behavior.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,"Advocates of MA grouping in early childhood education, who emphasize the positive, prosocial benefits of MA classrooms (Katz et al., 1990; Lloyd, 1999), may have predicted that MA environments would elicit more overt positive affect."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,"However, this was not the case here."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,It is not clear what to make from this finding.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,"To the extent that neutral affect is associated with goal directed and sustained on-task activity, one possibility that was explored was that this finding could be an artifact of perhaps increased on task activity in the MA classrooms but the lack of significant main effects for grouping on these variables (and the trends in the means actually being in the opposite direction favoring the SA classrooms argue against this possibility it is possible that young children are simply more overtly happy in SA than MA settings."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,"If this is the case, however, it would not be because they have a strong preference to be with SA peers."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,20,"As discussed below, the high rates of children spontaneously choosingMA playmates in the MA classrooms suggest that MA interaction is desired by the children further within them a classrooms of the observations that contained"

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,"Finally, it remains unclear whether frequent overt expression of positive affect by itself is ‘‘good’’ for children— positive affect can of course accompany a wide variety of childrens behaviors including both productive and off-task activity and pro- and antisocial behavior."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,Children’s expressed affect in the classroom is not something that has been explored before in the MA grouping literature
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,This new finding certainly begs for replication
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,4.2.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,Peer preferences in the MA classrooms An important question to answer within the context of MA preschool classrooms is: How much spontaneous MA interaction occurs in age diverse classrooms
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,Do the younger and older children in the classroom play together spontaneously or do age homogenous play groups dominate clearly whatever developmental consequences ma grouping may have for children will likely require significant interaction across ages to occur.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,"In this study, a considerable amount of cross-age interaction was observed to occur between the children in them a classrooms overall when play partners were free to vary children in the ma classes interacted either in a pair or in a small group with a peer of a different age62 of the time"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,interestingly this figure varied as a function of age of the target child.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,four year olds spent more time 75 interacting with the younger children than expected by chance alone and the 3 year olds spent less time with the older children (45%) than chance would predict.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,Although it is not clear from the present data whether the older children were actively seeking out the younger children for playmates or whether the younger children were actively entering or tagging along with older childrens activities this finding suggests at a minimum that at least some of the younger children were systematically choosing not to be with the older kids in the class.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,"Others (Caverly, Lemerise, & Harper, 2002; Lemerise, 1997) have found that among older, elementary age children in nongraded classrooms the younger children within the classroom tend to be less popular compared to the relatively older classmates the finding here however that 4 year olds appear to seek out affiliation with the younger children when given the chance suggests that different social dynamics may be at play among preschool age children such that younger children within this context are not disfavored"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,"This conclusion however, assumes that proximity is positively associated with friendship something worthy of future investigation among preschool age children."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,"Children in the MA classrooms overall, spent a considerable portion of their time (43%) when given a choice, interacting with a peer of the opposite gender (either one-on-one or within a small peer group that contained a child of a different gender and such mixed gender play was more common inside during ssatime49 than outside on the playground 35"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,21,Increased gender integration among children in multi-age environments compared to SA settings has been found previously field 1982roopnarineetal1992 and is typically seen as one of the benefits of MA grouping.

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"Further, analyses conducted within the MA classrooms revealed that children’s spontaneous play groups were significantly more likely to contain a member of the opposite gender when the playgroup was heterogeneous with respect to age47 than when the group contained only SA children (38%)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"The present study also replicates previous work lafreniere Strayer, & Gauthier, 1984; Martin & Fabes, 2001) in demonstrating that gender segregation was more common among girls than boys and more common for 4 year olds than 3 year olds"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"Given that gender segregated play has developmental consequences for children (Martin & Fabes, 2001) in terms of leading to increased sex stereotypical behavior patterns over time (e.g., increased rough play and aggression for boys), those interested in reducing gender segregation in their classrooms may consider MA grouping as one way to increase mixed- gender interaction during early childhood."

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"Change over time in MA classrooms This investigation was the first to report on MA preschool classrooms continuously throughout the entire school year, and thus contributes much needed longitudinal data to this area of study the social and behavioral ecology of ma preschool classrooms indeed changes significantly over the school year."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"As the school year progressed in the MA classrooms children’s sustained attention on activities increased linearly, and the proportion of time children spent engaging in focused, goal directed learning activities during SSA periods increased children in the ma classes also spent less time alone less time with a teacher and more time with their peersas theschool year progressed the extent to which these observed changes over time are due to: (a) development (the children did get older throughout the school year b peers getting more familiar with each other and helping each other work and stay focused orc the teacher getting better at organizing and scaffolding the childrens goal directed activities over time, (or some combination of all three) is, of course, unclear at the present time increased peer affiliation and increases in sustained attention and self control are certainly normative, age related developments known to occur across the preschool years (Bronson, 2000; Howes, 1988; Sarid & Breznitz, 1997)."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"Children’s expressed affect in the MA classrooms became less overtly positive and, instead, more neutral as time went on and children became more familiar with one another."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"Increases in neutral affect over time could be related to the concomitant increases in focused and sustained goal directed activity noted above, inasmuch as neutral affect may be more likely during focused learning activities"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,"nevertheless a reduction in children’s overt expressions of happiness from the beginning to the end of the year, coupled with the finding of less positive affect overall observed in MA relative to SA classes, could be a matter of some concern for early childhood educators implementing MA classes."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,Further study will have to determine whether this is a phenomenon specific to the particular classrooms observed or a more general trend observed in other MA classroom settings.
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,22,Of special note were the findings that age segregation and gender segregation in MA classrooms increase significantly from the beginning to the end of the year although them a classrooms had begun the school year with approximately 85% of children’s interactions

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,23,"This suggests that as preschool children develop, or as the children become more familiar with one another in the classroom, or both, their play gradually gravitates toward same gender and sa groupings normative age related increases in gender segregated play during the preschool years have been found by others (Leaper, 1994; Maccoby, 1998; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1987; Martin & Fabes, 2001), however, this investigation is the first to show the patterns of linear change in the frequency of mixed- gender peer interactions over the course of one school year within ma preschool classrooms"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,23,"Although not directly examined in the present study, it could be that the teachers were doing more to encourage MA and mixed gender interaction among the children early in the year and then gradually stopped doing so over time."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,23,"Informal impressions from the observers in these classrooms however, do not support this hypothesis as they did not become aware of any particular constraints or encouragements placed on children’s play partners by the teachers."

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,23,"Thus, although MA and mixed gender interaction are both common overall in MA classrooms it appears that the novelty of each wears off for the children and, as the school year progresses they tend to gravitate toward increasing age and gender homogeneity in their peer preferences"
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,23,"In terms of implications for early childhood practice, the results of this investigation suggest that early childhood teachers in ma settings who are in favor of maintaining age and gender integration in their classrooms may need to experiment with ways of increasing the structures and/or mechanisms in place on children’s playmate options."
The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,23,"Increases in teacher- provided structure and instructions have been found to increase children’s cross gender and MA play carpenter Huston, & Holt, 1986; Ellis, Rogoff, & Cromer, 1981; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1987)."

The social and behavioral ecology of mixed-age and same age preschool classrooms.pdf,23,"The results of this investigation clearly document that the effects of MA grouping in early childhood classrooms are complex, in that that they often interact with the age of child, they sometimes interact with the classroom context, and they fade over time."
